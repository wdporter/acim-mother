If you cannot hear the
Voice of God, it is because you do not choose to listen. The fact
that you *do* listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated by
your attitudes, your feelings, and your behavior. Your attitudes are
obviously conflicted, your feelings have a narrow range on the
negative side but are never purely joyous, and your behavior is
either strained or unpredictable. Yet this is what you *want.*
This is what you are fighting to keep and what you are vigilant to
save. Your minds are filled with schemes to save the face of your
egos, and you do not seek the Face of God. The glass in which the ego
seeks to see its face is dark indeed. How can it maintain the trick
of its existence except with mirrors? But where *you* look to
find yourself is up to you.

We have said that you
cannot change your mind by changing your behavior, but we have also
said, and many times before, that you *can* change your mind.
When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly, and this is so
whenever you are not joyous, then *know* this need not be. In
every case you have thought wrongly about some Soul that God created
and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass. Think
honestly what you have thought that God would *not* have thought
and what you have *not* thought that God would have you think.
Search sincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly,
and then change your minds *to think with God’s*.

This may seem hard to you,
but it is much easier than trying to think *against* it. Your
mind *is* one with God’s. Denying this and thinking
otherwise has held your ego together but has literally split your
mind. As a loving companion, I am deeply concerned with your mind and
urge you to follow my example as you look at yourselves and at each
other and see in both the glorious creations of a glorious
Mother.

When you are sad, *know
that this need not be*. Depression *always* arises ultimately
from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have.
*Know* you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions,
and then decide otherwise.

When you are anxious,
*know* that all anxiety comes from the capriciousness of the ego
*and need not be.* You can be as vigilant *against* the
ego’s dictates as *for* them.

When you feel guilty,
*know* that the ego has indeed violated the laws of God, but
*you* have not. Leave the sins of the ego to me. That is what
Atonement is for. But until you change your mind about those your ego
has hurt, the Atonement cannot release you. As long as you feel
guilty, your ego is in command because only the ego *can*
experience guilt. *This need not be.*

Watch your mind for the
temptations of the ego and do not be deceived by it. *Know* it
offers you nothing. When you have given up this voluntary
dispiriting, you will see how your mind can focus and rise above
fatigue and heal. Yet you are not sufficiently vigilant
*against* the demands of the ego to disengage yourself. *This
need not be.*

The habit of engaging
*with* God and Her creations is easily made if you actively
refuse to let your minds slip away. The problem is *not* one of
concentration; it is the belief that no one, including yourself, is
*worth* consistent effort. Side with me *consistently*
against this deception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull
you back. The disheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but
only the ego can *be* disheartened. Have you *really*
considered how many opportunities you have to gladden yourselves and
how many of them you have refused? There is no limit to the power of
Sons of God, but they themself can limit the expression of their power as
much as they choose.

Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away and releasing the 
strength of God into everything you think and will and do. Do not settle for 
anything *less* than this, and refuse to accept anything *but* this 
as your goal. Watch your minds carefully for *any* beliefs that 
hinder its accomplishment, and step away from them. Judge how well 
you have done this by your own feelings, for this is the one 
*right* use of judgement. Judgement, like any other defense, can 
be used to attack or protect, to hurt or to heal. The ego 
*should* be brought to your judgement and found wanting there. 
Without your own allegiance, protection, and love, it cannot exist. 
Judge your ego truly, and you *must* withdraw allegiance, 
protection, and love from it.

You are mirrors of truth
in which God Herself shines in perfect light. To the ego’s dark
glass you need but say, “I will not look there because I
*know* these images are not true”. Then let the Holy One
shine on you in peace, knowing that this and *only* this must
be. Her Mind shone on you in your creation and brought *your*
mind into being. Her Mind still shines on you and must shine
*through* you. Your ego cannot prevent *Her* from shining
on you, but it *can* prevent you from letting Her shine
*through* you.

The first coming of Christ is just another name for the creation, for Christ is the 
Child of God. The *second* coming of Christ means nothing more than the end 
of the ego’s rule over part of the minds of men and the healing of 
the mind. I was created like you in the first, and I have called you 
to join with me in the second. If you will think over your lives, you 
will see how carefully the preparations were made. I am in charge of 
the second coming, and my judgement, which is used only for 
protection, cannot be wrong because it *never* attacks. 
*Yours* is so distorted that you believe I was mistaken in 
choosing you. I assure you this is a mistake of your egos. Do 
*not* mistake it for humility.

Your egos are trying to convince you that *they* are real and *I* am not 
because, if *I* am real, I am no more real than *you* are. That 
knowledge, and I assure you that it *is* knowledge, means that 
Christ must come into your minds and heal them. Although I am 
*not* attacking your egos, I *am* working with your higher 
mind whether you are asleep or awake, just as your ego does with your 
lower mind. I am your vigilance in this, because you are too confused 
to recognise your own hope. I was *not* mistaken. Your minds 
*will* elect to join with mine, and together we are invincible.

You will yet come together
in my name, and your sanity will be restored. I raised the dead by
*knowing* that life is an eternal attribute of everything that
the living God created. Why do you believe it is harder for me to
inspire the dispirited or to stabilize the unstable? *I* do not
believe that there is an order of difficulty in miracles; *you*
do. I have called, and you will answer. I *know* that miracles
are natural because they are expressions of love. My calling you is
as natural as your answer and as inevitable.
