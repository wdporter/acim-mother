The Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Herself is there. Yet this is not a memory of past events, but only of a present state. You are so long accustomed to believe that memory holds only what is past that it is hard for you to realise it is a skill that can remember *now*. The limitations on remembering the world imposes on it are as vast as those you let the world impose on you. There *is* no link of memory to the past. If you would have it there, then there it is. But only your *desire* made the link, and only you have held it to a part of time where guilt appears to linger still.

The Holy Spirit’s use of memory is quite apart from time. He does not seek to use it as a means to keep the past, but rather as a way to let it *go*. Memory holds the message it receives and does what it is given it to do. It does not write the message nor appoint what it is for. Like to the body, it is purposeless within itself. And if it seems to serve to cherish ancient hate and offers you the pictures of injustices and hurts which you were saving, this is what you asked its message be, and this is what it is. Committed to its vaults, the history of all the body’s past is hidden there. All of the strange associations made to keep the past alive, the present dead, are stored within it, waiting your command that they be brought to you and lived again. And thus do their effects appear to be increased by time, which took away their cause.

Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing. It works hand in hand with all the other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed the truth about yourself. Time neither takes away nor can restore. And yet you make strange use of it, as if the past had caused the present, which is but a consequence in which no change can be made possible because its cause has gone. Yet change must have a cause that will endure or else it will not last. No change can be made in the present if its cause is past. Only the past is held in memory as you make use of it, and so it is a way to hold the past *against* the now.

Remember *nothing* that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught. And who would keep a senseless lesson in their mind when they can learn and can preserve a better one? When ancient memories of hate appear, remember that their cause is gone. And so you cannot understand what they are for. Let not the cause that you would give them now be what it was which made them what they were or seemed to be. Be glad that it is gone, for this is what you would be pardoned from. And see instead the new effects of cause accepted *now,* with consequences *here*. They will surprise you with their loveliness. The ancient new ideas they bring will be the happy consequences of a cause so ancient that it far exceeds the span of memory which your perception sees.

This is the Cause the Holy Spirit has remembered for you, when you would forget. It is not past because He let It not be unremembered. It has never changed because there never was a time in which He did not keep It safely in your mind. Its consequences will indeed seem new because you thought that you remembered not their Cause. Yet was It never absent from your mind, for it was not your Mother’s Will that She be unremembered by Her [only] Child.

What *you* remember never was. It came from causelessness which you confused with cause. It can deserve but laughter when you learn you have remembered consequences which were causeless and could *never* be effects. The miracle reminds you of a Cause forever present, perfectly untouched by time and interference — never changed from what It *is*. And *you* are Its effects, as changeless and as perfect as Itself. Its memory does not lie in the past nor waits the future. It is not revealed in miracles. They but remind you that It has not gone. When you forgive It for your sins, It will no longer be denied.

You who have sought to lay a judgement on your own Creator cannot understand it is not She Who laid a judgement on Her Child. You would deny Her Her effects, yet have they never been denied. There was no time in which Her Child could be condemned for what was causeless and against Her Will. What your remembering would witness to is but the fear of God. She has not done the thing you fear. No more have you. And so your innocence has not been lost. You need no healing to be healed. In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to have Its *own* effects and doing nothing that would interfere.

The miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant and is still. It reaches gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it healed in quiet then, to other minds to share its quietness. And they will join in doing nothing to prevent its radiant extension back into the Mind Which caused all minds to be. Born out of sharing, there can be no pause in time to cause the miracle delay in hastening to all unquiet minds and bringing them an instant’s stillness when the memory of God returns to them. Their own remembering is quiet now, and what has come to take its place will not be wholly unremembered afterwards.

He to Whom time is given [the Holy Spirit] offers thanks for every quiet instant given Him. For in that instant is Her memory allowed to offer all its treasures to the Child of God, for whom they have been kept. How gladly does He [Child of God] offer them unto the one for whom He has been given them! And His Creator shares His thanks because He would not be deprived of Her effects. The instant’s silence that Her Child accepts gives welcome to eternity and Her, and lets Them enter where They would abide. For in that instant does the Child of God do nothing that would make themself afraid.

How instantly the memory of God arises in the mind that has no fear to keep the memory away. Its own remembering has gone. There is no past to keep its fearful image in the way of glad awakening to present peace. The trumpets of eternity resound throughout the stillness, yet disturb it not. And what is now remembered is not fear, but rather is the cause that fear was made to render unremembered and undone. The stillness speaks in gentle sounds of love the Child of God remembers from before their own remembering came in between the present and the past to shut them out.

Now is the Child of God at last aware of present Cause and Its benign effects. Now do they understand what they have made is causeless, making no effects at all. They have done nothing. And in seeing this, they understand they never had a need for doing anything and never did. Their Cause *is* Its effects. There never was a cause beside It that could generate a different past or future. Its effects are changelessly eternal, beyond fear, and past the world of sin entirely.

What has been lost, to see the causeless not? And where is sacrifice, when memory of God has come to take the place of loss? What better way to close the little gap between illusions and reality than to allow the memory of God to flow across it, making it a bridge an instant will suffice to reach beyond? For God has closed it with Herself. Her memory has not gone by and left a stranded Child forever on a shore where they can glimpse another shore which they can never reach. Their Mother wills that they be lifted up and gently carried over. *She* has built the bridge, and it is She Who will transport Her Child across it. Have no fear that She will fail in what She wills. Nor that you be excluded from the Will that is for you.
