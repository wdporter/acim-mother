This is Palm Sunday, the 
celebration of victory and the acceptance of the truth. Let us not 
spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion of God’s Child, 
but happily in the celebration of their release. For Easter is the sign 
of peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no meaning. But a *risen* 
Christ becomes the symbol of the Child of God’s forgiveness of 
themself; the sign they look upon themself as healed and whole.
