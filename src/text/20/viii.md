We have said much about
discrepancies of means and end and how these must be brought in line
before your holy relationship can bring you only joy. But we have
also said the means to meet the Holy Spirit’s goal will come from
the same Source as does His purpose. Being so simple and direct, this
course has nothing in it that is not consistent. The seeming
inconsistencies or parts you find more difficult than others are
merely indications of areas where means and end are still discrepant.
And this produces great discomfort. This need not be. This course
requires almost nothing of you. It is impossible to imagine one that
asks so little or could offer more.

The period of discomfort that follows the sudden change in a relationship from sin to holiness should now be almost over. To the extent you still experience it, you are refusing to leave the means to Him Who changed the purpose. You 
recognise you want the goal. Are you not also willing to accept the 
means? If you are not, let us admit that *you* are inconsistent. 
A purpose is *attained* by means, and if you want a purpose, you *must* 
be willing to want the means as well. How can one be sincere and say, 
“I want this above all else, and yet I do not want to learn the 
means to get it”?

To obtain the goal, the
Holy Spirit indeed asked little. He asks no more to give the means as
well. The means are second to the goal. And when you hesitate, it is
because the *purpose* frightens you, and *not* the means. Remember this,
for otherwise you will make the error of believing the means are
difficult. Yet how can they be difficult if they are merely *given*
you? They guarantee the goal, and they are perfectly in line with it.
Before we look at them a little closer, remember that if you think
they are impossible, your wanting of the *purpose* has been shaken. For
if a goal is possible to reach, the means to do so must be possible
as well.

It *is* impossible to see your companions as sinless and yet to look upon them as a body. Is this not perfectly consistent with the goal of holiness? For holiness 
is merely the result of letting the effects of sin be lifted so what 
was always true is recognised. To see a sinless *body* is 
impossible, for holiness is positive, and the body is merely neutral. 
It is not sinful, but neither is it sinless. As nothing, which it is, 
the body cannot meaningfully be invested with attributes of Christ *or* 
of the ego. Either must be an error, for both would place the 
attributes where they cannot be. And both must be undone for purposes 
of truth.

The body *is* the
means by which the ego tries to make the unholy relationship seem
real. The unholy instant *is* the time of bodies. But the
*purpose* here is sin. It cannot be attained *but* in illusion,
and so the illusion of a companion as a body is quite in keeping with
the purpose of unholiness. Because of this consistency, the means
remain unquestioned while the end is cherished. Vision adapts to
wish, for sight is always secondary to desire. And if you see the
body, you have chosen judgment and not vision. For vision, like
relationships, has no order. You either *see* or not.

Who sees a companion’s
body has laid a judgment on them and sees them not. They [the judger] do not really see them [companion] as sinful; they does not see them at all. In the darkness of
sin, they [companion] are invisible. They can but be imagined in the darkness, and it
is here that the illusions you hold about them are not held up to their
reality. Here are illusions and reality kept separated. Here are
illusions never brought to truth and always hidden from it. And here
in darkness is your companion’s reality imagined as a body, in
unholy relationships with other bodies, serving the cause of sin an
instant before they die.

There is indeed a
difference between this vain imagining and vision. The difference
lies not in them, but in their purpose. Both are but means, each one
appropriate to the end for which it is employed. Neither can serve
the purpose of the other, for each one is a choice of purpose,
employed on its behalf. Either is meaningless without the end for
which it was intended, nor is it valued as a separate thing apart
from the intention. The means seem real because the *goal* is valued.
And judgment has no value *unless* the goal is sin.

The body cannot be looked
upon except through judgment. To see the body is the sign that you
lack vision and have denied the means the Holy Spirit offers you to
serve *His* purpose. How can a holy relationship achieve its purpose
through the means of sin? Judgment you taught yourself; vision is
learned from Him Who would *undo* your teaching. His vision cannot see
the body because it cannot look on sin. And thus it leads you to
reality. Your holy companion, sight of whom is your release, is no
illusion. Attempt to see them not in darkness, for your imaginings
about them *will* seem real there. You closed your eyes to shut them out.
Such was your purpose, and while this purpose seems to have any
meaning, the means for its attainment will be evaluated as worth the
seeing, and so you will not see.

Your question should not
be, “How can I see my companion without the body?”. Ask only,
“Do I *really* wish to see them sinless?”. And as you ask,
forget not that their sinlessness is *your* escape from fear.
Salvation is the Holy Spirit’s goal. The means is vision. For
what the seeing look upon *is* sinless. No one who loves can
judge, and what they see is free of condemnation. And what they
sees they did not make, for it was given them to see, as was the vision
which made their seeing possible.
