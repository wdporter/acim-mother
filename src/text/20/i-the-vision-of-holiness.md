This is Palm Sunday, the celebration of victory and the acceptance of the 
truth. Let us not spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion of God’s 
Son, but happily in the celebration of his release. For Easter is the sign of 
peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no meaning. But a risen Christ becomes the 
symbol of the Son of God’s forgiveness on himself; the sign he looks upon 
himself as healed and whole.

This week begins with palms and ends with lilies, the white and holy sign the 
Son of God is innocent. Let no dark sign of crucifixion intervene between the 
journey and its purpose; between the acceptance of the truth and its 
expression. This week we celebrate life, not death. And we honour the perfect 
purity of the Son of God, and not his sins. Offer your companion the gift of 
lilies, not the crown of thorns; the gift of love and not the “gift” of fear. 
You stand beside your companion, thorns in one hand and lilies in the other, 
uncertain which to give. Join now with me and throw away the thorns, offering 
the lilies to replace them. This Easter I would have the gift of your 
forgiveness offered by you to me, and returned by me to you. We cannot be 
united in crucifixion and in death. Nor can the resurrection be complete until 
your forgiveness rests on Christ, along with mine.

A week is short, and yet this holy week is the symbol of the whole journey the 
Son of God has undertaken. He started with the sign of victory, the promise of 
the resurrection, already given him. Let him not wander into the temptation of 
crucifixion, and delay him there. Help him to go in peace beyond it, with the 
light of his own innocence lighting his way to his redemption and release. 
Hold him not back with thorns and nails when his redemption is so near. But 
let the whiteness of your shining gift of lilies speed him on his way to 
resurrection. 

Easter is not the celebration of the _cost_ of sin, but of its _end._ If you 
see glimpses of the face of Christ behind the veil, looking between the 
snow-white petals of the lilies you have received and given as your gift, you 
will behold your companions’ face and recognise it. I was a stranger and you 
took me in, not knowing who I was. Yet for your gift of lilies you will know. 
In your forgiveness of these strangers, aliens to you and yet your ancient 
Friends, lies their release and your redemption with them. The time of Easter 
is a time of joy, and not of mourning. Look on your risen Friends, and 
celebrate their holiness along with me. For Easter is the time of your 
salvation, along with mine. <a href="https://acim.org/acim/en/s/242?wid=toc#1" class="whitespace-nowrap" title="view on acim.org">T-20.I</a>
