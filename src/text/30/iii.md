Do you not understand that
to oppose the Holy Spirit is to fight *yourself*? He tells you
but *your* will; He speaks for *you.* In His divinity is
but your own. And all He knows is but your knowledge, saved for you
that you may do your will through Him. God *asks* you do your
will. She joins with *you*. She did not set Her Realm up alone.
And Heaven itself but represents your will, where everything created
is for you. No spark of life but was created with your glad consent,
as you would have it be. And not one Thought that God has ever had
but waited for your blessing to be born. God is no enemy to you. She
asks no more than that She hear you call Her “Friend”.

How wonderful it is to do
your will! For that is freedom. There is nothing else that ever
should be called by freedom’s name. Unless you do your will, you
are not free. And would God leave Her Child without what they have chosen
for themself? God but ensured that you would never lose your will when
She gave you Her perfect answer. Hear it now that you may be reminded
of Her Love and learn your will. God would not have Her Child made
prisoner to what they do not want. She *joins* with you in
willing you be free. And to oppose Her is to make a choice against
*yourself* and choose that *you* be bound.

Look once again upon your
enemy, the one you chose to hate instead of love. For thus was hatred
born into the world, and thus the rule of fear established there. Now
hear God speak to you through Him Who is Her Voice and yours as well,
reminding you that it is not your will to hate and be a prisoner to
fear, a slave to death, a little creature with a little life. Your
will is boundless; it is not your will that it be bound. What lies in
you has joined with God Herself in all creation’s birth. Remember
She Who has created you and through your will created everything. Not
one created thing but gives you thanks, for it is by your will that
it was born. No light of Heaven shines except for you, for it was set
in Heaven by your will.

What cause have you for
anger in a world which merely waits your blessing to be free? If you
be prisoner, then God Herself could not be free. For what is done to
they whom God so loves is done to God Herself. Think not She wills to
bind you, Who has made you co-creator of the universe along with Her.
She would but keep your will forever and forever limitless.

This world awaits the freedom you will give when you have recognised that 
*you* are free. But you will not forgive the world until you have forgiven Her 
Who gave your will to you. For it is *by* your will the world is 
given freedom. Nor can you be free apart from Her Whose holy Will you 
share. God turns to you to ask the world be saved, for by your own 
salvation it is healed. And no one walks upon the earth but must 
depend on your decision, that they learn death has no power over them 
because they share your freedom as they share your will. It *is* 
your will to heal them, and because you have decided *with* them, 
they are healed. And now is God forgiven, for you chose to look upon 
your companion as a friend.
