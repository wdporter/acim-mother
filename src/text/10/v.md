Never forget that the
Family of God is your salvation, for the Family of God is your Soul. As God’s
creation, it is yours, and belonging to you, it is Hers. Your Soul
does not need salvation, but your mind needs to learn what salvation
*is*. You are not saved *from* anything, but you are saved
*for* glory. Glory is your inheritance, given your Soul by its
Creator that you might *extend* it. Yet if you hate part of your
own Soul, *all* your understanding is lost because you are
looking on what God created as *yourself* without love. And
since what She created is part of Her, you are denying Her Her place
in Her own altar.

Could you try to make God
homeless and know that *you* are at home? Can the Child deny the
Mother *without* believing that the Mother has denied
*them*? God’s laws hold only for your protection, and they
never hold in vain. What you experience when you deny your Mother is
still for your protection, for the power of your will cannot be
lessened without the intervention of God *against* it, and any
limitation on your power is not the Will of God. Therefore, look
*only* to the power that God gave to save you, remembering that
it is yours *because* it is Hers, and join with your companions in
Her peace.

The peace of your Soul
lies in its limitlessness. Limit the peace you share, and your own
Soul *must* be unknown to you. Every altar to God is part of
your Soul because the light She created is one with Her. Would you cut
off companions from the light that is yours? You would not do so if
you realised that you can only darken your *own* mind. As you
bring *them* back, so will *your* mind return. That is the
law of God for the protection of the wholeness of Her Child.

*Only you can deprive yourself of anything*. Do not oppose this realisation, for 
it is truly the beginning of the dawn of light. Remember also that the
denial of this simple fact takes many forms, and these you must learn
to recognise and to oppose steadfastly and *without exception*.
This is a crucial step in the reawakening. The beginning phases of
this reversal are often quite painful for, as blame is withdrawn from
without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within. It is difficult
at first to realise that this is *exactly* the same thing, for
there *is* no distinction between within and without.

If your companions are part
of you and you blame *them* for your deprivation, you *are*
blaming yourself. And you cannot blame yourself *without*
blaming them. That is why blame must be undone, *not*
re-allocated. Lay it to yourself and you cannot *know* yourself,
for *only* the ego blames at all. Self-blame is therefore ego
identification and as strong an ego defense as blaming others. *You
cannot enter God’s Presence if you attack Her Child*. When Her
Child lifts their voice in praise of their Creator, they *will* hear the
Voice of their Mother. Yet the Creator cannot be praised *without*
Her child, for their glory is shared, and they are glorified
together.

Christ is at God’s
altar, waiting to welcome Her Child. But come wholly without
condemnation, for otherwise you will believe that the door is barred
and you cannot enter. The door is *not* barred, and it is
impossible for you to be unable to enter the place where God would
have you be. But love yourself with the love of Christ, for so does
your Mother love you. You can *refuse* to enter, but you
*cannot* bar the door which Christ holds open. Come unto me who
holds it open *for* you, for while I live it cannot be shut, and
I live forever. God is my life *and yours*, and nothing is denied by God to Her Child. [Remember that to deny is to *refuse to accept*, and *everything* awaits *only* your acceptance.]

At God’s altar Christ
waits for the restoration of Himself in *you*. God knows Her Child 
as wholly blameless as Herself, and She is approached through the
appreciation of Her Child. Christ waits for your acceptance of Him as
*yourself* and of His wholeness as *yours*. For Christ is the Child of God Who lives in their Creator and shines with Her glory. Christ is the extension of the love and the loveliness of God, as perfect as His Creator and at peace with Her.

Blessed is the Child of God,
whose radiance is of their Mother and whose glory they will to share as
their Mother shares it with them. There is no condemnation in the Child,
for there is no condemnation in the Mother. Sharing the perfect love
of the Mother, the Child must share what belongs to Her, for otherwise
they will not know the Mother *or* the Child. Peace be unto you who
rest in God and in whom the whole Family of God rests.
