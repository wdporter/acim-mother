When you are weary,
remember you have hurt yourself. Your Comforter will rest you, but
*you* cannot. You do not know *how*, for if you did you
could never have grown weary. Unless you have hurt yourselves, you
could never suffer in *any* way, for that is not God’s Will
for Her Child. Pain is not of Her, for She knows no attack and Her peace
surrounds you silently. God is very quiet, for there is no conflict
in Her. Conflict is the root of all evil, for being blind, it does
not see whom it attacks. Yet it *always* attacks the Child of God,
and the Child of God is *you*.

God’s Child is indeed in
need of comfort, for they know not what they do, believing their will is
not their own. The Realm is theirs, and yet they wander homelessly. At
home in God, they are lonely, and amid all their companions, they are
friendless. Would God *let* this be real if She did not will to
be alone Herself? And if your will is Hers, it cannot be true of you
*because* it is not true of Her. Oh, my children, if you knew
what God wills for you, your joy would be complete! And what She wills
*has* happened, for it was *always* true.

When the light comes and
you have said, “God’s Will is mine”, you will see such
beauty that you will *know* it is not of you. Out of your joy
you will create beauty in Her Name, for *your* joy could no more
be contained than Hers. The bleak little world will vanish into
nothingness, and your heart will be so filled with joy that it will
leap into Heaven and into the Presence of God. I cannot tell you what
this will be like, for your hearts are not ready. Yet I *can*
tell you and remind you often that what God wills for Herself She
wills for *you*, and what She wills for you *is* yours.

The way is not hard, but
it *is* very different. Yours is the way of pain, of which God
knows nothing. *That* way is hard indeed and very lonely. Fear and grief are your guests, and they go with you and abide with you on the way. But the dark journey is not the way of God’s Child. Walk in light, and do not see the dark companions, for they are not fit companions for the Child of God, who was created *of* Light and
*in* Light. The Great Light always surrounds you and shines out
*from* you. How can you see the dark companions in a light such
as this? If you see *them*, it is only because you are
*denying* the light. But deny *them* instead, for the light
is here, and the way is clear.

God hides nothing from Her
Child, even though Her Child would hide themself. Yet the Child of God
cannot hide their glory, for God wills them to be glorious and gave them
the light that shines in them. You will never lose your way, for God
leads you. When you wander, you but undertake a journey which is not
real. The dark companions, the dark way, are all illusions. Turn
toward the light, for the little spark in you is part of a light so
great that it can sweep you out of all darkness forever. For your
Mother *is* your Creator, and you *are* like Her.

The children of light
cannot abide in darkness, for darkness is not in them. Do not be
deceived by the dark comforters, and never let them enter the mind of
God’s Child, for they have no place in Her temple. When you are
tempted to deny Her, remember that there *are* no other gods
that you can place before Her, and accept Her Will for you in peace.
For you *cannot* accept it otherwise.

Only God’s Comforter
*can* comfort you. In the quiet of Her temple, He waits to give
you the peace that is yours. *Give* Her peace that you may enter
the temple and find it waiting for you. But be holy in the Presence
of God, or you will not know that you are there. For what is unlike
God cannot enter Her Mind because it was not Her Thought and
therefore does not belong to Her. And *your* minds must be as
pure as Hers if you would know what belongs to *you*. Guard
carefully Her temple, for She Herself dwells there and abides in
peace. You cannot enter God’s Presence with the dark companions
beside you, but you also cannot enter alone.

*All* your companions
must enter *with* you, for until you have accepted them,
*you* cannot enter. For you cannot understand Wholeness unless
*you* are whole, and no part of the Child can be excluded if they
would know the Wholeness of their Mother. In your mind, you can accept
the whole Family of God and bless it with the light your Mother gave it.
Then you will be worthy to dwell in the temple *with* Her
because it is *your* will not to be alone. God blessed Her Child
forever. If you will bless them in time, you will *be* in
eternity. Time cannot separate you from God if you use it on
*behalf* of the eternal.
