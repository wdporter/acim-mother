You who have spent your lives in bringing truth to illusion, reality to 
fantasy, have walked the way of dreams. For you have gone from waking to 
sleeping and on and on to a yet deeper sleep. Each dream has led to other 
dreams, and every fantasy which seemed to bring a light into the darkness but 
made the darkness deeper. Your *goal* was darkness in which no ray of light 
could enter. And you sought a blackness so complete that you could hide from 
truth forever in complete insanity. What you forgot was simply that God cannot 
destroy Herself. The light is *in* you. Darkness can cover it but *cannot* put 
it out.

As the light comes nearer, you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the 
truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear and sometimes to stark 
terror. But you *will* advance because your goal *is* the advance from fear to 
truth. You *know* this. The goal which you accepted *is* the goal of 
knowledge, for which you signified your willingness. Fear seems to live in 
darkness, and when you are afraid, you have stepped back. Let us then join 
quickly in an instant of light, and it will be enough to remind you that your 
goal *is* light. Truth has rushed to meet you since you called upon it.

If you knew Who walks beside you on this way which you have chosen, fear would 
be impossible. You do not know because the journey into darkness has been long 
and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. A little flicker of your eyelids, 
closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in 
yourselves, so long despised. You go toward love, still hating it and terribly 
afraid of its judgement upon you. And you do not realise that you are not 
afraid of love, but only of what you have made of it. You are advancing to 
love’s meaning and away from all illusions in which you have surrounded it. 
When you retreat to the illusion, your fear increases, for there is little 
doubt that what you think it means *is* fearful. Yet what is that to us who 
travel surely and very swiftly *away* from fear?

You who hold each other’s hand also hold mine, for when you joined each other 
you were not alone. Do you believe that I would leave you in the darkness you 
agreed to leave with *me*? In your relationship is this world’s light. And 
fear *must* disappear before you now. Be tempted not to snatch away the gift 
of faith you offered to each other. You will succeed only in frightening 
yourselves. The gift is given forever, for God Herself received it. You 
*cannot* take it back. You have accepted God. The holiness of your 
relationship is established in Heaven. You do not understand what you 
accepted, but remember that your understanding is not necessary. All that was 
necessary was merely the *wish* to understand. That wish was the desire to be 
holy. The Will of God is granted you. For you desire the only thing you ever 
had or ever were.

Each instant that we spend together will teach you that this goal is possible 
and will strengthen your desire to reach it. And in your desire lies its 
accomplishment. Your desire is now in complete accord with all the power of 
the Holy Spirit’s Will. No little, faltering footsteps that you may take can 
separate your desire from His Will and from His strength. I hold your hand as 
surely as you agreed to take each other’s. You will not separate, for I stand 
with you and walk with you in your advance to truth. And where we go, we 
carry God with us.

In your relationship, you have joined with me in bringing Heaven to the Son of 
God, who hid in darkness. You have been willing to bring the darkness to 
light, and this willingness has given strength to everyone who would remain in 
darkness. Those who would see *will* see. And they will join with me in 
carrying their light into the darkness when the darkness in them is offered to 
the light and is removed forever. My need for you, joined with me in the holy 
light of your relationship, is *your* need for salvation. Would I not give you 
what you gave to me? For when you joined each other, you answered me.

You who are now the bringers of salvation have the function of bringing light 
to darkness. The darkness in you *has* been brought to light. Carry it back to 
darkness from the holy instant to which you brought it. We are made whole in 
our desire to make whole. Let not time worry you, for all the fear that you 
experience is really past. Time has been reädjusted to help us do together 
what your separate pasts would hinder. You have gone past fear, for no two 
minds can join in the desire for love without love’s joining *them*.

Not one light in Heaven but goes with you. Not one ray that shines forever in 
the Mind of God but shines on you. Heaven is joined with you in your advance 
to Heaven. When such great light has joined with you to give the little spark of 
your desire the power of God Herself, *can* you remain in darkness? You are 
coming home together after a long and meaningless journey which you 
undertook apart and which led nowhere. You have found each other and will 
light each other’s way. And from this light will the Great Rays extend back into 
darkness and forward unto God to shine away the past and so make room for 
Her eternal Presence, in which everything is radiant in the light.
