You have been told to
bring the darkness to the light and guilt to holiness. And you have
also been told that error must be corrected at its source. Therefore,
it is the tiny part of yourself, the little thought that seems split
off and separate, which the Holy Spirit needs. The rest is fully in
God’s keeping and *needs* no guide. Yet this wild and delusional
thought needs help because in its delusions it thinks it is the Child
of God, whole and omnipotent, sole ruler of the realm it set apart
to tyrannize by madness into obedience and slavery.

This is the little part of
you you think you stole from Heaven. Give it back to Heaven. Heaven
has not lost it, but *you* have lost sight of Heaven. Let the Holy
Spirit remove it from the withered realm in which you set it off,
surrounded by darkness, guarded by attack, and reinforced by hate.
Within its barricades is still a tiny segment of the Child of God,
complete and holy, serene and unaware of what you think surrounds it.
Be you not separate, for the One Who *does* surround it has brought
union to you, returning your little offering of darkness to the
eternal Light.

How is this done? It is
extremely simple, being based on what this little realm really is.
The barren sands, the darkness and the lifelessness are seen only
through the body’s eyes. Its vision *is* distorted, and the
messages it transmits to you who made it to *limit* your
awareness *are* little and limited and so fragmented they are
meaningless. From the world of bodies, made by insanity, insane
messages seem to be returned to the mind which made it. And these
messages bear witness to this world, pronouncing it as true. For *you*
sent forth these messengers to bring this back to you.

Everything these messages
relay to you is quite external. There are no messages which speak of
what lies underneath, for it is not the body that *could* speak of
this. Its eyes perceive it not; its senses remain quite unaware of
it; its tongue cannot relay its messages. Yet God can bring you there
if you are willing to follow the Holy Spirit through seeming terror,
trusting Him not to abandon you and leave you there. For it is not
His purpose to frighten you, but only *yours*. You are severely tempted
to abandon Him at the outside ring of fear, but He would lead you
safely through and far beyond.

The circle of fear lies
just below the level the body sees and seems to be the whole
foundation on which the world is based. Here are all the illusions,
all the twisted thoughts, all the insane attacks, the fury,
vengeance, and betrayal that were made to keep the guilt in place, so
that the world could rise from it and keep it hidden. Its shadow
rises to the surface, enough to hold its most external manifestations
in darkness and to bring despair and loneliness to it and keep it
joyless. Yet its intensity is veiled by its heavy coverings and kept
apart from what was made to keep it hidden. The body cannot see this,
for the body arose from this for its protection, which must always
depend on keeping it *not* seen. The body’s eyes will never look on
it. Yet they will see what it dictates.

The body will remain
guilt’s messenger and will act as it directs as long as you
believe that guilt is real. For the reality of guilt is the illusion
which seems to make it heavy and opaque, impenetrable, and a real
foundation for the ego’s thought system. Its thinness and
transparency are not apparent until you see the light *behind*
it. And then you see it as a fragile veil before the light.

This heavy-seeming
barrier, this artificial floor which looks like rock, is like a bank
of low dark clouds that seems to be a solid wall before the sun. Its
impenetrable appearance is wholly an illusion. It gives way softly to
the mountain tops which rise above it and has no power at all to hold
back anyone willing to climb above it and see the sun. It is not
strong enough to stop a button’s fall nor hold a feather.
[Nothing can rest upon it, for it is but an *illusion* of a
foundation.] Try but to touch it and it disappears; attempt to grasp
it and your hands hold nothing.

Yet in this cloud bank, it
is easy to see a whole world rising. A solid mountain range, a lake,
a city, all rise in your imagination, and from the clouds the
messengers of your perception return to you, assuring you that it is
all there. Figures stand out and move about, actions seem real, and
forms appear and shift from loveliness to the grotesque. And back and
forth they go, as long as you would play the game of children’s
make-believe. Yet however long you play it, and regardless of how
much imagination you bring to it, you do not confuse it with the
world below, nor seek to make it real.

So should it be with the
dark clouds of guilt, no more impenetrable and no more substantial.
You will not bruise yourself against them in traveling through. Let
your Guide *teach* you their unsubstantial nature as He leads you past
them, for beneath them is a world of light whereön they cast no
shadows. Their shadows lie upon the world beyond them, still further
from the light. Yet from them *to* the light their shadows
cannot fall.

This world of light, this
circle of brightness, is the real world where guilt meets with
forgiveness. Here the world outside is seen anew, without the shadow
of guilt upon it. Here are you forgiven, for here you have forgiven
everyone. Here is the new perception, where everything is bright and
shining with innocence, washed in the waters of forgiveness, and
cleansed of every evil thought you had laid upon it. Here there is no
attack upon the Child of God, and you are welcome. Here is your
innocence, waiting to clothe you and protect you and make you ready
for the final step in the journey inward. Here are the dark and heavy
garments of guilt laid by and gently replaced by purity and
love.

Yet even forgiveness is
not the end. Forgiveness *does* make lovely, but it does not create. It
is the source of healing, but it is the messenger of love and not its
Source. Here you are led that God Herself can take the final step
unhindered, for here does nothing interfere with love, letting it be
itself. A step beyond this holy place [of forgiveness], a step still
further inward but the one *you* cannot take, transports you to
something completely different. Here is the Source of light — nothing
perceived, forgiven, nor transformed, but merely *known*.
