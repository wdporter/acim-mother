There is no problem in any situation that faith will not solve. There is no shift in any aspect of the problem but will make solution impossible. For if you shift part of the problem elsewhere, the meaning of the problem *must* be lost, and the solution to the problem is inherent in its meaning. Is it not possible that all your problems *have* been solved, but you have removed yourself from the solution? Yet faith must be where something has been done and where you *see* it done. A situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts. If problems are perceived, it is because the thoughts are judged to be in conflict. But if the goal is truth, this is impossible. Some idea of bodies must have entered, for minds cannot attack.

The thought of bodies is the sign of faithlessness, for bodies cannot solve anything. And it is their intrusion on the relationship, an error in your thoughts *about* the situation, which then becomes the justification for your lack of faith. You *will* make this error, but be not at all concerned with that. The error does not matter. Faithlessness brought to faith will never interfere with truth. But faithlessness used *against* truth will always destroy faith. If you lack faith, ask that it be restored where it was *lost* and seek not to have it made up to you elsewhere as if you had been unjustly deprived of it.

Only what *you* have not given can be lacking in *any* situation. But remember this: the goal of holiness was set for your relationship and *not* by you. You did not set it because holiness cannot be seen *except* through faith, and your relationship was not holy *because* your faith in one another was so limited and little. Your faith must grow to meet the goal that has been set. The goal’s reality will call this forth, for you will see that peace and faith will not come separately. What situation *can* you be in without faith and remain faithful to each other?

Every situation in which you find yourself is but a means to meet the purpose set for your relationship. See it as something else, and you *are* faithless. Use not your faithlessness. Let it enter and look upon it calmly, but do not *use* it. Faithlessness is the servant of illusion and wholly faithful to its master. Use it and it will carry you straight to illusions. Be tempted not by what it offers you. It interferes not with the goal, but with the value of the goal to *you*. Accept not the illusion of peace it offers, but look upon its offering and recognise it *is* illusion.

The goal of illusion is as closely tied to faithlessness as faith to truth. If you lack faith in anyone to fulfil, and *perfectly*, their part in any situation dedicated in advance to truth, *your* dedication is divided. And so you have been faithless to each other and used your faithlessness *against* each other. No relationship is holy unless its holiness goes with it everywhere. As holiness and faith go hand in hand, so must its faith go everywhere with it. The goal’s reality will call forth and *accomplish* every miracle needed for its fulfillment. Nothing too small or too enormous, too weak or too compelling, but will be gently turned to its use and purpose. The universe will serve it gladly, as it serves the universe. But do not *interfere*.

The power set in you in whom the Holy Spirit’s goal has been established is so far beyond your little conception of the infinite that you have no idea how great the strength that goes with you. And you can use *this* in perfect safety. Yet for all its might, so great it reaches past the stars and to the universe that lies beyond them, your little faithlessness can make it useless if you would use the faithlessness instead.

Yet think on this, and learn the *cause* of faithlessness: You think you hold against the other what they have done to you. But what you really blame them for is what *you* did to *them*. It is not *their* past but *yours* you hold against them. And you lack faith in them because of what *you* were. Yet you are as innocent of what you were as they are. What never was is causeless and is not *there* to interfere with truth. There *is* no cause for faithlessness, but there *is* a Cause for faith. That Cause has entered any situation which shares Its purpose. The light of truth shines from the centre of the situation and touches everyone to whom the situation’s purpose calls. It calls to *everyone*. There is no situation which does not involve your *whole* relationship in every aspect and complete in every part. You can leave nothing of yourself outside it and keep the situation holy. For it shares the purpose of your whole relationship and derives its meaning from it.

Enter each situation with the faith that you give to each other, or you *are* faithless to your own relationship. Your faith will call the others to share your purpose, as this same purpose called forth the faith in *you*. And you will see the means you once employed to lead you to illusions transformed to means for truth. [Truth calls for faith, and faith makes room *for truth*.] When the Holy Spirit changed the purpose of your relationship by exchanging yours for His, the goal He placed there was extended to every situation in which you enter or will *ever* enter. And every situation was thus made free of the past, which would have made it purposeless.

You call for faith because of Him Who walks with you in *every* situation. You are no longer wholly insane, nor no longer alone. For loneliness in God *must* be a dream. You whose relationship shares the Holy Spirit’s goal are
set apart from loneliness because the truth has come. Its call for faith is strong. Use not your faithlessness against it, for it calls you to salvation and to peace.
