Anything in this world
that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt
you and will do so. Not because it has the power to hurt, but just
because you have denied it is but an illusion and made it real. And
it *is* real to you. It is *not* nothing and through its
perceived reality has entered all the world of sick illusions. All
belief in sin, in power of attack, in hurt and harm, in sacrifice and
death has come to you. For no one can make *one* illusion real
and still escape the rest. For who can choose to keep the ones which
they prefer and find the safety that the truth alone can give? Who can
believe illusions are the same and still maintain that even one is
best?

Lead not your little lives
in solitude with one illusion as your only friend. This is no
friendship worthy of God’s Child, nor one with which they could
remain content. Yet God has given them a better Friend in Whom all
power in earth and Heaven rests. The one illusion that *you*
think is friend obscures *His* grace and majesty from you and
keeps His friendship and forgiveness from your welcoming embrace.
Without Him you *are* friendless. Seek not another friend to
take His place. There *is* no other friend. What God appointed
has no substitute, for what illusion can replace the truth?

Who dwells with shadows is
alone indeed, and loneliness is not the Will of God. Would you allow
one shadow to usurp the throne that God appointed for your Friend if
you but realised its emptiness has left *yours* empty and
unoccupied? Make no illusion friend, for if you do, it can but take
the place of Him whom God has called your Friend. And it is He who is
your *only* Friend in truth. He brings you gifts that are not of
this world, and only He to whom they have been given can make sure
that you receive them. He will place them on your throne when you
make room for Him on His.
