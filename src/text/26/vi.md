A little hindrance can
seem large indeed to those who do not understand that miracles are
all the same. Yet teaching that is what this course is *for*.
This is its only purpose, for only that is all there is to learn. And
you can learn it many different ways. All learning is a help or
hindrance to the gate of Heaven. Nothing in between is possible.
There are two teachers only, who point in different ways. And you
will go along the way your chosen teacher leads. There are but two
directions you can take while time remains and choice is meaningful.
For never will another road be made except the way to Heaven. You but
choose whether to go *toward* Heaven or away to nowhere. There
*is* nothing else to choose.

Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is [nothing. It is] but a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real Teacher of the world. Yet since you *do* believe in [its reality], why should you waste it
going nowhere when it *can* be used to reach a goal as high as
learning can achieve? Think not the way to Heaven’s gate is
difficult at all. Nothing you undertake with certain purpose and high
resolve and happy confidence, holding each other’s hand and
keeping step to Heaven’s song, is difficult to do. But it is hard
indeed to wander off, alone and miserable, down a road which leads to
nothing and which has no purpose.

God gave Her Teacher to
replace the one you made, not to conflict with it. And what She would
replace has been replaced. Time lasted but an instant in your mind,
with no effect upon eternity. And so is all time passed and
everything exactly as it was before the way to nothingness was made.
The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all of
them within that one mistake, held also the *correction* for
that one and all of them that came within the first. And in that tiny
instant time was gone, for that was all it ever was. What God gave
Answer to *is* answered and is gone.

To you who still believe
you live in time and know not it is gone, the Holy Spirit still
guides you through the infinitely small and senseless maze you still
perceive in time, though it has long since gone. You think you live
in what is past. Each thing you look upon you saw but for an instant,
long ago before its unreality gave way to truth. Not one illusion
still remains unanswered in your mind. Uncertainty was brought to
certainty so long ago that it is hard indeed to hold it to your heart
as if it were before you still.

The tiny instant you would
keep and make eternal passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to
notice it had come. What disappeared too quickly to affect the simple
knowledge of the Child of God can hardly still be there for you to
choose to be your teacher. Only in the past—an ancient past, too
short to make a world in answer to creation—did this world appear to
rise. So very long ago, for such a tiny interval of time that not one
note in Heaven’s song was missed.

Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgement, and in all belief in 
sin, is that one instant still called back, as if it could be made again in time. 
You keep an ancient memory before your eyes. And they who live in 
memories alone is unaware of where they are.

[Forgiveness is the great
release from time. It is the key to learning that the past is over.
Madness speaks no more. There *is* no *other* teacher and no
*other* way. For what has been undone no longer is. And who can
stand upon a distant shore and dream themself across an ocean to a
place and time that have long since gone by? How *real* a
hindrance can this dream be to where they really *are*? For this is
fact and does *not* change whatever dreams they have. Yet can they
still *imagine* they are elsewhere and in another time. In the
extreme, they can delude themself that this is true and pass from mere
imagining into belief and into madness, quite convinced that where they
would prefer to be, they *are*.]

Is this a *hindrance*
to the place whereön they stand? Is any echo from the past that they may
hear a fact in what is there to hear where they are now? And how much
can their own delusions about time and place affect a change in where
they really are? The unforgiven is a voice that calls out from a past
forever more gone by. And everything which points to it as real is
but a wish that what is gone could be made real again and seen as
here and now in place of what is *really* now and here. Is this
a hindrance to the truth the past is gone and cannot be returned to
you? And do you *want* that fearful instant kept, when Heaven
seemed to disappear and God was feared and made a symbol of your
hate?

Forget the time of terror
that has been so long ago corrected and undone. Can sin withstand the
Will of God? Can it be up to you to see the past and put it in the
present? You can *not* go back. And everything that points the
way in the direction of the past but sets you on a mission whose
accomplishment can only be unreal. Such is the justice your
ever-loving Mother has ensured must come to you. And from your own
unfairness to yourself has She protected you. You *cannot* lose
your way because there is no way but Hers and nowhere can you go
except to Her.

Would God allow Her Child to lose their way along a road long since a memory of time gone by? [This course will teach you *only* what is now.] A dreadful instant in a distant past, now perfectly corrected, is of no concern nor value. Let the dead and gone be peacefully forgotten. Resurrection has come to take its place. And now you are a part of resurrection, *not*
of death. No past illusions have the power to keep you in a place of
death, a vault God’s Child entered an instant, to be instantly
restored unto Her Mother’s perfect Love. And how can they be kept
in chains long since removed and gone forever from their mind?

The Child that God created is as free as God created them. They were reborn 
the instant that they chose to die instead of live. And will you not forgive them 
now because they made an error in the past that God remembers not and is 
not there? Now you are shifting back and forth between the past and 
present. Sometimes the past seems real, as if it were the present. 
Voices from the past are heard and then are doubted. You are like to 
one who still hallucinates but lacks conviction in what they perceive. 
This is the borderland between the worlds, the bridge between the 
past and present. Here the shadow of the past remains, but still a 
present light is dimly recognised. Once it is seen, this light can 
never be forgotten. It must draw you from the past into the present, 
where you really *are*.

The shadow voices do not
change the laws of time or of eternity. They come from what is past
and gone and hinder not the true existence of the here and now. The
real world is the second part of the hallucination time and death are
real and have existence which can *be* perceived. This terrible
illusion was denied in but the time it took for God to give Her
answer to illusion for all time and every circumstance. And then it
was no more, to be experienced as there.

Each day and every minute
in each day and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive
the single instant when the time of terror was replaced by love. And
so you die each day to live again until you cross the gap between
past and present, which is not a gap at all. Such is each life—a
seeming interval from birth to death and on to life again, a
repetition of an instant gone by long ago, which cannot *be*
relived. And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is
still here and now.

Forgive the past and let
it go, for it *is* gone. You stand no longer on the ground that
lies between the worlds. You have gone on and reached the world that
lies at Heaven’s gate. There is no hindrance to the Will of God
nor any need that you repeat again a journey that was over long ago.
Look gently on each other and behold the world in which perception of
your hate has been transformed into a world of love.
