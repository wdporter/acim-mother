The world you see is based on “sacrifice” of oneness. It is a picture of a complete disunity and total lack of joining. Around each entity is built a wall so seeming solid that it looks as if what is inside can never reach without, and what is out can never reach and join with what is locked away within the wall. Each part must sacrifice the other part to keep itself complete. For if they joined, each one would lose its own identity, and by their separation are their selves maintained.

The little that the body fences off *becomes* the self, preserved through sacrifice of all the rest. And all the rest must *lose* this little part, remaining incomplete to keep its own identity intact. In this perception of yourself, the body’s loss would be a sacrifice indeed. For sight of bodies becomes the sign that sacrifice is limited and something still remains for you alone. And for this little to belong to you are limits placed on everything outside, just as they are on everything you think is yours. For giving and receiving *are* the same. And to accept the limits of a body is to impose these limits on each companion whom you see. For you must see them as you see yourself.

The body *is* a loss and *can* be made to sacrifice. And while you see your companion as a body, apart from you and separate in their cell, you are demanding sacrifice of them *and* you. What greater sacrifice could be demanded than that God’s Child perceive themself without their Mother? And their Mother be without Their Child? Yet every sacrifice demands that they be separate and without the other. The memory of God *must* be denied if any sacrifice is asked of anyone. What witness to the wholeness of God’s Child is seen within a world of separate bodies, however much they witness to truth? They [God’s Child] are *invisible* in such a world. Nor can their song of union and of love be heard at all. Yet is it given them [witnesses] to make the world recede before their [God’s Child] song and sight of them replace the body’s eyes.

Those who would see the witnesses to truth instead of to illusion merely ask that they might see a purpose in the world that gives it sense and makes it meaningful. Without your special function *has* this world no meaning for you. Yet it can become a treasure house as rich and limitless as Heaven itself. No instant passes here in which your companion’s holiness cannot be seen, to add a limitless supply to every meagre scrap and tiny crumb of happiness that you allot yourself.

You *can* lose sight of oneness, but can *not* make sacrifice of its reality. Nor can you *lose* what you would sacrifice nor keep the Holy Spirit from His task of showing you that it has not been lost. Hear then the song your companions sing to you. And let the world recede and take the rest their witness offers on behalf of peace. But judge them not, for you will hear no song of liberation for yourself nor see what it is given them to witness to that you may see it and rejoice with them. Make not their holiness a sacrifice to your belief in sin. You sacrifice *your* innocence with theirs and die each time you see in them a sin deserving death.

Yet every instant can you be reborn and given life again. Their holiness gives life to you, who cannot die because their sinlessness is known to God and can no more be sacrificed by you than can the light in you be blotted out because they
see it not. You who would make a sacrifice of life and make your eyes and ears bear witness to the death of God and of Her holy Child, think not that you have power to make of them what God willed not they be. In Heaven God’s Child is not imprisoned in a body nor is sacrificed in solitude to sin.

And as they [God’s Child] are in Heaven, so must they be eternally and everywhere. They are the same forever — born again each instant, untouched by time and far beyond the reach of any sacrifice of life or death. For neither did they make, and only one was given them by One Who knows Her gifts can never suffer sacrifice and loss. God’s justice rests in gentleness upon Her Child and keeps them safe from all injustices the world would lay upon them. Could it be that *you* could make their sins reality and sacrifice their Mother’s Will for them?

Condemn them not by seeing them within the rotting prison where they see themself. It is your special function to ensure the door be opened that they may come forth to shine on you and give you back the gift of freedom by receiving it of you. What is the Holy Spirit’s special function but to release the holy Child of God from the imprisonment they made to *keep* themself from justice? Could your function be a task apart and separate from His [the Holy Spirit’s] Own?
