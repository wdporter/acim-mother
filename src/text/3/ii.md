1\. The miracle abolishes
the need for lower-order concerns. Since it is an out-of-pattern time
interval, the ordinary considerations of time and space do not apply.
When *you* perform a miracle, *I* will arrange both time
and space to adjust to it.

2\. Clear distinction
between what *has been* created and what *is being* created
is essential. *All* forms of correction (or healing) rest on
this *fundamental* correction in level perception.

3\. Another way of stating
the above point is: Never confuse right- with wrong-mindedness.
Responding to *any* form of miscreation with anything *except
a desire to heal* (or a miracle) is an expression of this
confusion.

4\. The miracle is always a
*denial* of this error and an affirmation of the truth. Only
right-mindedness *can* create in a way that has any real effect.
Pragmatically, what has no real effect has no real existence. Its
effect, then, is emptiness. Being without substantial content, it
lends itself to projection in the improper sense.

5\. The level-adjustment power of the miracle induces the right perception for 
healing.  Until this has occurred, healing cannot be understood. Forgiveness is 
an empty gesture unless it entails correction. Without this it is 
essentially judgemental rather than healing.

6\. Miraculous forgiveness is *only* correction. It has *no* element of 
judgement at all. “Father forgive them for they know not what they 
do” in no way evaluates *what* they do. It is strictly limited to an appeal to God 
to heal their minds. There is no reference to the outcome of their mis-thought. 
*That* does not matter.

7\. The biblical injunction, “Be of one mind” is the statement for 
revelation-readiness. My *own* injunction, “Do this in 
remembrance of me” is the request for coöperation from miracle 
workers. It should be noted that the two statements are not in the 
same order of reality. The latter involves a time awareness since to 
remember implies recalling the past in the present. Time is under 
*my* direction, but Timelessness belongs to God alone. In time 
we exist for and with each other. In Timelessness we coëxist with
God.
