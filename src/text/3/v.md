We have been emphasising perception and have said very little about cognition as yet because you are confused about the difference between them. The reason we have dealt so little with cognition is because you must get your perceptions straightened out before you can *know* anything. To know is to be certain. Uncertainty merely means that you do *not* know. Knowledge is power *because* it is certain, and certainty is strength. Perception is merely temporary. It is an attribute of the space–time belief and is therefore subject to fear or love. Misperceptions produce fear, and true perceptions produce love. *Neither* produces certainty because *all* perception varies. That is why it is *not* knowledge.

True perception is the *basis* for knowledge, but *knowing* is the affirmation of truth. All your difficulties ultimately stem from the fact that you do not recognise or *know* yourselves, each other, or God. To recognise means to “know again”, implying that you knew before. You can see in many ways because perception involves different interpretations, and this means that it is not whole. The miracle is a way of perceiving, *not* of knowing. It is the right answer to a question, and you do not ask questions at all when
you know.

Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them. The miracle, or the “right answer”, corrects them. Since perceptions *change*, their dependence on time is obvious. They are subject to transitory states, and this necessarily implies variability. How you perceive at any given time determines what you *do*, and action *must* occur in time. Knowledge is timeless because certainty is *not* questionable. You *know* when you have *ceased* to ask questions.

The questioning mind perceives itself in time and therefore looks for *future* answers. The unquestioning mind is closed because it believes the future and present will be the same. This establishes an unchanged state or stasis. It is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear that the future will be *worse* than the present, and this fear inhibits the tendency to question at all.

Visions are the natural perception of the Spiritual eye, but they are still corrections. The Spiritual eye is symbolic and therefore not a device for knowing. It *is*, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain of the miracle. Properly speaking, “a vision of God” is a miracle rather than a revelation. The fact that perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of knowledge. That is why visions do not last.

The Bible instructs you to “*know* yourself” or *be certain*. Certainty is *always* of God. When you love someone, you have perceived them as they are, and this makes it possible for you to *know* them. However, it is not until you *recognise* them that you *can* know them. While you ask questions about God, you are clearly implying that you do *not* know Her. Certainty does not require action. When you say that you are *acting* on the basis of knowledge, you are really confusing perception and cognition. Knowledge brings the mental strength for creative *thinking* but *not* for
right *doing*. Perception, miracles and doing are closely related. Knowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought. Perception involves the body, even in its most spiritualised form. Knowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is certain. To perceive the truth is *not* the same as knowing it.

If you attack error in one another, you will hurt yourself. You cannot *recognise* each other when you attack. Attack is *always* made on a stranger. You are *making* them a stranger by misperceiving thEm so that you *cannot* know them. It is *because* you have made them a stranger that you are afraid of them. *Perceive* them correctly so that you can *know* them. Right perception is necessary before God can communicate directly to Her own altars which She has established in Her Children. There She can communicate Her certainty, and *Her* knowledge will bring peace *without* question.

God is not a stranger to Her Children, and Her Children are not strangers to each other. Knowledge preceded both perception and time and will ultimately replace them. That is the real meaning of the Biblical description of God as “Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End”. It also explains the quotation, “Before Abraham was *I am*”. Perception can and must be stabilised, but knowledge *is* stable. “Fear God and keep Her  commandments” should read “*Know* God and accept Her certainty”. There are no strangers in Her creation. To create as She created, you can create only what you *know* and accept as yours. God knows Her Children with perfect certainty. She created them *by* knowing them. She recognised them perfectly. When they do not recognise each other, they do not recognize Her.
