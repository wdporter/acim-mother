There is another point
which must be perfectly clear before any residual fear which may
still be associated with miracles becomes entirely groundless. The
crucifixion did *not* establish the Atonement. The resurrection
did. This is a point which many very sincere Christians have
misunderstood. No one who is free of the scarcity-error could
*possibly* make this mistake. If the crucifixion is seen from an
upside-down point of view, it *does* appear as if God permitted
and even encouraged one of Her Children to suffer *because* they was
good. Many ministers preach this every day.

This particularly
unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of the combined
misprojections of a large number of my would-be followers, has led
many people to be bitterly afraid of God. This particularly
anti-religious concept enters into many religions, and this is
neither by chance nor by coincidence. Yet the real Christian would
have to pause and ask, “How could this be?”. Is it likely
that God Herself would be capable of the kind of thinking which Her
own words have clearly stated is unworthy of people?

The best defense, as
always, is not to attack another’s position but rather to protect
the truth. It is unwise to accept *any* concept if you have to
turn a whole frame of reference around in order to justify it. This
procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic
on a mass basis. Persecution is a frequent result, undertaken to
justify the terrible misperception that God Herself persecuted Her
own Child on behalf of salvation. The very words are meaningless.

It has been particularly
difficult to overcome this because, although the error itself is no
harder to overcome than any other error, men were unwilling to give
this one up because of its prominent “escape” value. In
milder forms a parent says, “This hurts me more than it hurts
you”, and feels exonerated in beating a child. Can you believe
that the Mother *really* thinks this way? It is so essential
that *all* such thinking be dispelled that we must be very sure
that *nothing* of this kind remains in your mind. I was
*not* punished because *you* were bad. The wholly benign
lesson the Atonement teaches is lost if it is tainted with this kind
of distortion in *any* form.

“Vengeance is
Mine sayeth the Lord”, is a strictly karmic viewpoint. It is a
real misperception of truth by which people assigns their own
“evil” past to God. The “evil conscience” from
the past has nothing to do with God. She did not create it, and She
does not maintain it. God does *not* believe in karmic
retribution. Her Divine Mind does not create that way. *She* does
not hold the evil deeds of a person even against themself. Is it likely,
then, that She would hold against anyone the evil that *another*
did?

Be very sure that you
recognize how utterly impossible this assumption really is and how
*entirely* it arises from misprojection. This kind of error is
responsible for a host of related errors including the belief that
God rejected people and forced them out of the Garden of Eden. It is also
responsible for the fact that you may believe from time to time that
I am misdirecting you. I have made every effort to use words that are
almost impossible to distort, but people are very inventive when it comes
to twisting symbols around.

God Herself is *not*
symbolic; She is *fact*. The Atonement too is totally without
symbolism. It is perfectly clear because it exists in light. Only
peoples’ attempts to shroud it in darkness have made it inaccessible
to the unwilling and ambiguous to the partly willing. The Atonement
itself radiates nothing but truth. It therefore epitomizes
harmlessness and sheds *only* blessing. It could not do this if
it arose from anything but perfect innocence. Innocence is wisdom
because it is unaware of evil, which does not exist. It is, however,
*perfectly* aware of *everything* that is true.

The Resurrection
demonstrated that *nothing* can destroy truth. Good can
withstand *any* form of evil because light abolishes *all*
forms of darkness. The Atonement is thus the perfect lesson. It is
the final demonstration that all of the other lessons which I taught
are true. People are released from *all* errors if they believe in
this. The deductive approach to teaching accepts the generalization
which is applicable to *all* single instances rather than
building up the generalization after analyzing numerous single
instances separately. If you can accept the *one* generalization
*now*, there will be no need to learn from many smaller
lessons.

*Nothing* can prevail against a Child of God who commends their Spirit into the hands of their Mother. By doing this, the mind awakens from its sleep, and [the Soul] remembers its Creator. All sense of separation disappears, and level confusion vanishes. The Child of God *is* part of the Holy Trinity, but the
Trinity itself is *One*. There is no confusion within its levels
because they are of One Mind and One Will. This single purpose
creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God. Yet
this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent.

Because their hearts are
pure, the innocent defend true perception instead of defending
themselves *against* it. Understanding the lesson of the
Atonement, they are without the will to attack, and therefore they
see truly. This is what the Bible means when it says, “When He
shall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like Him, for we shall see
Him as He *is*”.

Sacrifice is a notion
totally unknown to God. It arises solely from fear. This is
particularly unfortunate because frightened people are apt to be
vicious. Sacrificing another in *any* way is a clear cut
violation of God’s own injunction that people should be merciful
even as their Mother in Heaven. It has been hard for many Christians to
realise that this commandment (or assignment) also applies to
*themselves.* Good teachers never terrorize their students. To
terrorize is to attack, and this results in rejection of what the
teacher offers. The result is learning failure.

I have been correctly
referred to as “the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the
world”. Those who represent the lamb as blood-stained, an
all-too-widespread error, do *not* understand the meaning of the
symbol. Correctly understood, it is a very simple parable which
merely speaks of my innocence. The lion and the lamb lying down
together refers to the fact that strength and innocence are
*not* in conflict but naturally live in peace. “Blessed are
the pure in heart for they shall see God” is another way of
saying the same thing.

There has been some human
controversy about the nature of seeing in relation to the integrative
powers of the brain. Correctly understood, the issue revolves around
the question of whether the body or the mind can see (or understand).
This is not really open to question at all. The body is not capable
of understanding, and only the mind can perceive *anything*. A
pure mind knows the truth, and this *is* its strength. It cannot
attack the body because it recognizes exactly what the body
*is.* This is what “a sane mind in a sane body” really
means. It does *not* confuse destruction with innocence because
it associates innocence with strength, *not* with weakness.

Innocence is
*incapable* of sacrificing anything because the innocent mind
*has* everything and strives only to *protect* its
wholeness. This is why it *cannot* misproject. It can only honour
people because honour is the natural greeting of the truly loved to
others who are like them. The lamb taketh away the sins of the world
only in the sense that the state of innocence, or grace, is one in
which the meaning of the Atonement is perfectly apparent. The
innocence of God is the true state of mind of Her Child. In this state,
peoples’ minds *do* see God, [and because] they sees Her as She is, [they know] that the Atonement, *not* sacrifice, is the *only*
appropriate gift to Her own altar, where nothing except
true perfection  belongs. The understanding of the innocent is
*truth*. That is why their altars are truly radiant.
