We have repeatedly stated
that the basic concepts referred to in this course are *not*
matters of degree. Certain fundamental concepts *cannot* be
meaningfully understood in terms of coexisting polarities. It is
impossible to conceive of light and darkness, or everything and
nothing, as joint possibilities. They are all true *or* all
false. It is essential that you realize that behavior is erratic
until a firm commitment to one or the other is made.

A firm commitment to
darkness or nothingness is impossible. No one has ever lived who has
not experienced *some* light and *some* [of everything]. This makes everyone really unable to deny truth totally, even if they generally deceives themselves in this connection. That is why those who live largely in darkness and emptiness never find any lasting solace. Innocence is *not* a partial attribute. It is not a real defense
*until* it is total. When it is partial, it is characterized by
the same erratic nature that holds for other two-edged defenses.

The partly innocent are
apt to be quite stupid at times. It is not until their innocence
becomes a genuine viewpoint which is universal in its application
that it becomes wisdom. Innocent (or true) perception means that you
*never* misperceive and *always* see truly. More simply, it
means that you never see what does not really exist. When you lack
confidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief
that they is not in their right mind. This is hardly a miracle-based
frame of reference. It also has the disastrous effect of denying the
creative power of the miracle.

The miracle perceives
everything *as it is*. If nothing but the truth exists (and this
is really a redundant statement because what is not true
*cannot* exist) right-minded seeing cannot see anything
*but* perfection. We have said many times that *only* what
God creates, or what people create with the same will, has any real
existence. This, then, is all the innocent can see. They do not
suffer from the distortions of the separated ones. The way to correct
all such distortions is to withdraw your *faith* from them and
invest it *only* in what is true.

You *cannot* validate
the invalid. I would suggest that you voluntarily give up all such
attempts because they can only be frantic. If you are willing to
validate what *is* true in everything you perceive, you will
make it true for *you*. Truth overcomes *all* error. This
means that if you perceive truly, you are canceling out
misperceptions in yourself *and* in others simultaneously.
Because you see them as they are, you offer them your own validation
of *their* truth. This is the healing which the miracle actively
fosters.
