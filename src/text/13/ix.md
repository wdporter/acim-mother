When you accept companions’ guiltlessness, you will see the Atonement in them. For
by proclaiming it in them, you make it *yours,* and you
*will* see what you sought. You will not see the symbol of your
companions’ guiltlessness shining within them while you still
believe it is not there. *Their* guiltlessness is *your*
Atonement. Grant it to them, and you will see the truth of what you
have acknowledged. Yet truth is offered *first* to be received,
even as God gave it first to Her Child. The first in time means
nothing, but the First in eternity is God the Mother, Who is both
First and One. Beyond the First, there is no other, for there is no
order, no second or third and nothing *but* the First.

You who belong to the
First Cause, created by Her like unto Herself and part of Her, are
more than merely guiltless. The state of guiltlessness is only the
condition in which what is not there has been removed from the
disordered mind that thought it *was*. This state, and only
this, must *you* attain with God beside you. For until you do,
you will still think that you are separate from Her. You can feel Her
Presence next to you but *cannot* know that you are one with
Her. This need not be taught. Learning applies only to the condition
in which it happens *of itself*.

When you have let all that
obscured the truth in your most holy mind be undone for you and stand
in grace before your Mother, She will give Herself to you as She has
always done. Giving Herself is all She knows, and so it is all
knowledge. For what She knows not cannot be and therefore cannot be
given. Ask not to be forgiven, for this has already been
accomplished. Ask, rather, to learn how to *forgive* and restore
what always was to your unforgiving mind. Atonement becomes real and
visible to them that *use* it. On earth this is your only
function, and you must learn that it is all you *want* to
learn.

You *will* feel
guilty till you learn this. For in the end, whatever form it takes,
your guilt arises from your failure to fulfill your function in
God’s Mind with all of *yours*. Can you escape this guilt by
failing to fulfill your function here? You need not understand
creation to do what must be done before that knowledge would be
meaningful to you. God breaks no barriers; neither did She *make*
them. When *you* release them, they are gone. God will not fail
nor ever has in anything.

Decide that God is right
and *you* are wrong about yourself. She created you out of
Herself but still within Her. She *knows* what you are. Remember
that there is no second to Her. There cannot, therefore, be anyone
without Her Holiness nor anyone unworthy of Her perfect Love. Fail
not in your function of loving in a loveless place made out of
darkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone. Fail
not *yourself,* but instead offer to God *and you* Her
blameless Child. For this small gift of appreciation for Her Love, God
will Herself exchange your gift for Hers.

Before you make *any*
decisions for yourself, remember that you have decided *against*
your function in Heaven and consider carefully whether you
*want* to make decisions here. Your function here is only to
decide *against* deciding what you want in recognition that you
do not *know.* How, then, can you decide what you should do?
Leave all decisions to the One Who speaks for God and for your
function as He *knows* it. So will He teach you to remove the
awful burden you have laid upon yourself by loving not the Child of God
and trying to teach them guilt instead of love. Give up this frantic
and insane attempt, which cheats you of the joy of living with your
God and Mother, and awaking gladly to Her Love and Holiness, which
join together as the truth in you, making you one with Her.

When you have learned how
to decide *with* God, all decisions become as easy and as right
as breathing. There is no effort, and you will be led as gently as if
you were being carried along a quiet path in summer. Only your own
volition seems to make deciding hard. The Holy Spirit will not delay
at all in answering your *every* question what to do. He
*knows*. And He will *tell* you and then do it *for*
you. You who are tired might consider whether this is not more
restful than sleep. For you can bring your guilt into sleeping but
not into this.
