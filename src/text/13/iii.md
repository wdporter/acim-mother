Guilt remains the only
thing that hides the Mother, for guilt is the attack upon Her Son.
The guilty *always* condemn, and having done so, they
*will* condemn, linking the future to the past as is the
ego's law. Fidelity unto this law lets no light in, for it
*demands* fidelity to darkness and *forbids* awakening. The
ego's laws are strict, and breaches are severely punished.
Therefore give no obedience to its laws, for they are laws of
punishment. And those who follow them believe that they are guilty,
and so they *must* condemn. Between the future and the past, the
laws of God must intervene if you would free yourselves. Atonement
stands between them like a lamp that shines so brightly that the
chain of darkness in which you bound yourselves will disappear.*

Release from guilt is the
ego's whole undoing. *Make no one fearful*, for their guilt is
yours, and by obeying the ego's harsh commandments, you bring its
condemnation of yourself, and you will not escape the punishment it
offers those who obey it. The ego rewards fidelity to it with pain,
for faith in it *is* pain. And faith can be rewarded only in
terms of the belief in which the faith was placed. Faith *makes*
the power of belief, and where it is invested determines its reward.
For faith is *always* given what is treasured, and what is
treasured *is* returned to you.*

The world can give you
only what you gave it, for being nothing but your own projection, it
*has* no meaning apart from what you found in it and placed your
faith in. Be faithful unto darkness and you will *not* see,
because your faith will be rewarded as you *gave* it. You will
accept your treasure, and if you place your faith in the past, the
future *will* be like it. Whatever you hold as dear, you think
is *yours.* The power of your *valuing* will make it
so.*

Atonement brings a
re-evaluation of everything you cherish, for it is the means by which
the Holy Spirit can separate the false and the true, which you have
accepted into your minds *without distinction.* Therefore,
*you* cannot value one without the other, and guilt has become
as true *for you* as innocence. You do not believe the Son of
God is guiltless because you see the past and see *him* not.
When you condemn a companion, you are saying, "I who was guilty
choose to *remain* so." You have denied *their* freedom,
and by so doing you have denied the witness unto *yours.* You
could as easily have *freed* them from the past and lifted from
their mind the cloud of guilt that binds them to it. And in *their*
freedom would have been your *own*.

Lay not their guilt upon
them, for their guilt lies in their secret that they think that  they have done
this unto *you*. Would you, then, teach them that they are
*right* in their delusion? The idea that the guiltless Son of God
can attack himself and *make* himself guilty is insane. In
*any* form, in *anyone*, *believe this not*. For sin
and condemnation are the same, and the belief in one is faith in the
other, calling for punishment *instead* of love. *Nothing*
can justify insanity, and to call for punishment upon yourself
*must* be insane.*

See no one, then, as
guilty, and you will affirm the truth of guiltlessness unto
*yourself*. In every condemnation that you offer the Son of God
lies the conviction of your *own* guilt. If you would have the
Holy Spirit make you free of it, accept His offer of Atonement for
all your companions. For so you learn that it is true for *you*.
Remember always that it is impossible to condemn the Son of God *in
part*. Those whom you see as guilty become the witnesses to guilt
in *you*, and you will *see* it there, for it *is*
there until it is undone. Guilt is *always* in your own mind,
which has condemned *itself*. Project it not, for while you do,
it cannot *be* undone. With everyone whom you release from
guilt, great is the joy in Heaven, where the witnesses to your
motherhood rejoice.*

Guilt makes you blind, for
while you see one spot of guilt within you, you will *not* see
the light. And by projecting it, the *world* seems dark and
shrouded in your guilt. You throw a dark veil over it and cannot see
it *because you cannot look within.* You are afraid of what you
would see there, but it is *not* there. *The thing you fear is
gone*. If you would look within, you would see only the Atonement,
shining in quiet and in peace upon the altar to your Mother.*

Do not be afraid to look
within. The ego tells you all is black with guilt within you and bids
you *not* to look. Instead, it bids you look upon your companions
*and see the guilt in them.* Yet this you cannot do without
remaining blind. For those who see their companions in the dark, and
guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too afraid to look
upon the light within. Within you is not what *you* believe is
there and what you put your faith in.*

Within you is the holy
sign of perfect faith your Mother has in you. She does not value you
as you do. She knows Herself and knows the truth in *you.* She
knows *there is no difference*, for She knows not of differences.
Can *you* see guilt where God *knows* there is perfect
innocence? You can *deny* Her knowledge, but you cannot
*change* it. Look, then, upon the light She placed within you and
learn that what you feared was there *has been* replaced with
love.*
