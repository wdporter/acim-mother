When we are all united in Heaven, you will value *nothing* that you value here. For nothing that you value here you value wholly, and so you do not value it at all. Value is where God placed it, and the value of what God esteems cannot *be* judged, for it has been *established*. It is *wholly* of value. It can merely be appreciated or not. To value it partially is not to *know* its value. In Heaven is everything God valued and nothing else. Heaven is perfectly unambiguous. Everything is clear and bright and calls forth *one* response. There is no darkness, and there is no contrast. There is no variation. There is no interruption. There is a sense of peace so deep that no dream in this world has ever brought even a dim imagining of what it is.

Nothing in this world can give this peace, for nothing in this world is wholly shared. Perfect perception can merely show you what is *capable* of being wholly shared. It can also show you the *results* of sharing while you still remember the results of *not* sharing. The Holy Spirit points quietly to the contrast, knowing that you will finally let Him judge the difference for you, allowing Him to demonstrate which *must* be true. He has perfect faith in your final judgement because He knows that He will make it *for* you. To doubt this would be to doubt that His mission will be fulfilled. How is this possible, when His mission is of God?

You whose minds are darkened by doubt and guilt, remember this: God gave the Holy Spirit to you and gave Him the mission to remove all doubt and every trace of guilt that Her dear Child has laid upon themself. It is *impossible* that this mission fail. Nothing can prevent what God would have accomplished from accomplishment. Whatever your reäctions to the Holy Spirit’s Voice may be, whatever voice you choose to listen to, whatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God’s Will *is* done. You *will* find the peace in which She has established you, because She does not change Her Mind. She is invariable as the peace in which you dwell and of which the Holy Spirit reminds you.

You will not remember change and shift in Heaven. You have need of contrast only here. Contrast and differences are necessary teaching aids, for by them you learn what to avoid and what to seek. When you have learned this, you will find the answer that makes the need for *any* differences disappear. Truth comes of its own will unto its own. When you have learned that you *belong* to truth, it will flow lightly over you without a difference of any kind. For you will need no contrast to help you realise that this is what you want, and *only* this. Fear not the Holy Spirit will fail in what your Mother has given Him to do. The Will of God can fail in *nothing*.

Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep *you* from it or *it* from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you. The Holy Spirit will restore your sanity, because insanity is *not* the Will of God. If that suffices Her, it is enough for you. You will not keep what God would have removed, because it breaks communication with you with whom She would
communicate. Her voice *will* be heard.

The Communication Link which God Herself placed within you, joining your minds with Hers, *cannot* be broken. You may believe you *want* it broken, and this belief *does* interfere with the deep peace in which the sweet and constant communication which God would share with you is known. Yet Her channels of reaching out cannot be wholly closed and separated from Her. Peace will be yours, because Her peace still flows to you from Her Whose Will *is* peace. You have it *now.* The Holy Spirit will teach you how to *use* it and, by projecting it, to learn that it is in you.

God willed you Heaven and will *always* will you nothing else. The Holy Spirit knows *only* of Her Will. There is no chance that Heaven will not be yours, for God is sure, and what She wills is as sure as She is. You will learn salvation, because you will learn *how to save*. It will not be possible to exempt yourself from what the Holy Spirit wills to teach you. Salvation is as sure as God. Her certainty suffices. Learn that even the darkest nightmare that disturbed the mind of God’s sleeping Child holds no power over them. They *will* learn the lesson of awaking. God watches over them, and light surrounds them.

Can God’s Child lose themself in dreams when God has placed *within* them the glad call to waken and be glad? They cannot separate *themself* from what is *in* them. Their sleep will not withstand the call to wake. The mission of redemption will be fulfilled as surely as the creation will remain unchanged throughout eternity. You do not have to know that Heaven is yours to make it so. It *is* so. Yet the Will of God must be accepted as *your* will to know it.

The Holy Spirit cannot fail to undo *for* you everything you have learned that teaches you what is not true must be reconciled with truth. This is the reconciliation which the ego would substitute for your reconciliation unto sanity and unto peace. The Holy Spirit has a very different kind of reconciliation in His Mind for you, and one which He *will* effect as surely as the ego will *not* effect what it attempts.

Failure is of the ego, *not* of God. From Her you *cannot* wander, and there is no possibility that the plan the Holy Spirit offers to everyone for the salvation *of* everyone will not be perfectly accomplished. You *will* be released, and you will not remember anything you made that was not created *for* you and *by* you in return. For how can you remember what was *never* true or *not* remember what has always been? It is this reconciliation with truth, and *only* truth, in which the peace of Heaven lies.
