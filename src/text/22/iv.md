The introduction of reason
into the ego’s thought system is the beginning of its undoing.
For reason and the ego are contradictory. Nor is it possible for them
to co-exist in your awareness. And reason’s goal is to make plain
and therefore obvious. You can *see* reason. This is not a play
on words, for here is the beginning of a vision that has meaning.
Vision is sense, quite literally. If it is not the body’s sight,
it *must* be understood. For it is *plain*, and what is
obvious is not ambiguous. It *can* be understood. And here do
reason and the ego separate to go their different ways.

The ego’s whole
continuance depends on its belief you cannot learn this course. Share
this belief, and reason will be unable to see your errors and make
way for their correction. For reason sees *through* errors,
telling you what you thought was real is not. Reason can see the
difference between sin and mistakes because it *wants*
correction. Therefore, it tells you what you thought was
uncorrectable *can* be corrected, and thus it must have been an
error. The ego’s opposition to correction leads to its fixed
belief in sin and disregard of errors. It looks on *nothing*
that can be corrected. Thus does the ego damn and reason save.

Reason is not salvation in
itself, but it makes way for peace and brings you to a state of mind
in which salvation can be given you. Sin is a block, set like a heavy
gate, locked and without a key, across the road to peace. No one who
looks on it without the help of reason would try to pass it. The
body’s eyes behold it as solid granite, so thick it would be
madness to attempt to pass it. Yet reason sees through it easily
*because* it is an error. The form it takes cannot conceal its
emptiness from reason’s eyes.

*Only* the form of
error attracts the ego. Meaning it does not recognize and does not
know if it is there or not. Everything which the body’s eyes can
see is a mistake, an error in perception, a distorted fragment of the
whole, without the meaning that the whole would give. And yet
mistakes, regardless of their form, can be corrected. Sin is but
error in a special form the ego venerates. It would preserve all
errors and make them sins. For here is its own stability, its heavy
anchor in the shifting world it made—the rock on which its church is
built and where its worshipers are bound to bodies and believe the
body’s freedom is their own.

Reason will tell you that
the form of error is not what makes it a mistake. If what the form
*conceals* is a mistake, the form cannot prevent correction. The
body’s eyes see *only* form. They cannot see beyond what
they were *made* to see. And they were made to look on error and
not see past it. Theirs is indeed a strange perception, for they can
see only illusions, unable to look beyond the granite block of sin
and stopping at the outside form of nothing. To this distorted form
of vision, the outside of everything, the wall that stands between
you and the truth, is wholly true. Yet how can sight which stops at
nothingness as if it were a solid wall see truly? It is held back by
form, having been made to guarantee that nothing else but form will
be perceived.

These eyes, made
*not* to see, will *never* see. For the idea they represent
left not its maker, and it is their maker that sees through them.
What was its maker’s *goal* but not to see? For this the
body’s eyes are perfect means, but not for *seeing*. See how the body’s eyes rest on externals and cannot go beyond. Watch how they stop at nothingness, unable to go beyond the form to meaning. Nothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding has been obscured.

Only *mistakes* have
different forms, and so they can deceive. You can change form
*because* it is not true. It could not be reality, *because*
it can be changed. Reason will tell you that, if form is not reality,
it must be an illusion and is not *there* to see. And if you see
it, you must be mistaken, for you are seeing what can *not* be
real as if it *were*. What cannot see beyond what is not there
*must* be distorted perception and must perceive illusions as
the truth. Could it then *recognize* the truth?

Let not the *form* of
their mistakes keep you from them whose holiness is yours. Let not the
vision of their holiness, the sight of which would show you your
forgiveness, be kept from you by what the body’s eyes can see.
Let your awareness of your companion not be blocked by your perception
of their sins and of their body. What is there in them that you would
attack except what you associate with their body, which *you*
believe can sin? Beyond their errors is *their* holiness and
*your* salvation. You gave them not their holiness but tried to see
your sins in them to save yourself. And yet their holiness *is*
your forgiveness. Can *you* be saved by making sinful the one
whose holiness is your salvation?

A holy relationship,
however newly born, must value holiness above all else. Unholy values
will produce confusion, and in *awareness*. In an unholy
relationship, each one is valued because they seems to justify the
other’s sin. They see within the other what impels them to sin
against their will. And thus they lay their sins upon the other and are
attracted to them to *perpetuate* their sins. And so it must become
impossible for each to see themself as *causing* sin by their
desire to have sin real. Yet reason sees a holy relationship as what
it is—a common state of mind, where both give errors gladly to
correction that both may happily be healed as one.
