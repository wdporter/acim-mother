Projection makes
perception. The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than
that. But though it is no more than that, it is not less. Therefore,
to you it is important. It is the witness to your state of mind, the
outside picture of an inward condition. As a person thinketh, so do they
perceive. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but will to change
your mind *about* the world. Perception is a *result*, not
a cause. And that is why order of difficulty in miracles is
meaningless. Everything looked upon with vision is healed and holy.
Nothing perceived without it means anything. And where there is no
meaning, there is chaos.

Damnation is your judgment on yourself, and this you *will* project upon the world. See it as damned, and all you see is what you did to hurt the Child of God. If you behold disaster and catastrophe, you tried to crucify them. If you 
see holiness and hope, you joined the Will of God to set them free. 
There is no choice that lies between these two decisions. And you 
*will* see the witness to the choice you made and learn from 
this to *recognise* which one you chose. [The world you see but 
shows you how much joy *you* have allowed yourself to see in you 
and to accept as *yours*. And if this *is* its meaning, 
then the power to *give* it joy *must* lie *within* you.]
