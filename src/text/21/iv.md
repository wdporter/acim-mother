All special relationships
have sin as their goal. For they are bargains with reality, toward
which the seeming union is adjusted. Forget not this — to bargain is to
set a limit, and any companion with whom you have a limited
relationship *you hate*. You may attempt to keep the bargain in
the name of “fairness”, sometimes demanding payment of
yourself, perhaps more often of the other. Thus in the
“fairness” you attempt to ease the guilt that comes from
the accepted purpose of the relationship. And that is why the Holy
Spirit must change its purpose to make it useful to *them* and
harmless unto *you*.

If you accept this change, you have accepted the idea of making room for truth. 
The *source* of sin is gone. You may imagine that you still 
experience its effects, but it is not your purpose, and you no longer 
*want* it. No one allows a purpose to be replaced while they 
desire it, for nothing is so cherished and protected as is a goal 
the mind accepts. This it will follow, grimly or happily, but always 
with faith and with the persistence that faith inevitably brings. The 
power of faith is *never* recognised if it is placed in sin. But 
it is *always* recognised if it is placed in love.

Why is it strange to you
that faith can move mountains? This is indeed a little feat for such
a power. For faith can keep the Child of God in chains as long as they
believe they *are* in chains. And when they are released from them 
[chains], it will be simply because they [Child of God] no longer believe in 
them [chains], withdrawing faith that they can hold them [Child of God] and placing it [faith] in their freedom instead. It is impossible to place equal faith 
in opposite directions. What faith you give to sin you *take away* from 
holiness. And what you offer holiness has been *removed* from sin.

Faith and belief and
vision are the means by which the goal of holiness is reached.
Through them the Holy Spirit leads you to the real world and away
from all illusions where your faith was laid. This is His direction,
the only one He ever sees. And when you wander, He reminds you there
*is* but one. His faith and His belief and vision are all for
you. And when you have accepted them completely instead of yours, you
will have need of them no longer. For faith and vision and belief are
meaningful only *before* the state of certainty is reached. In
Heaven they are unknown. Yet Heaven is reached through them.

It is impossible that the
Child of God lack faith, but they can choose where they would have it
*be*. Faithlessness is not a *lack* of faith, but faith in
*nothing*. Faith given to illusions does not lack power, for by
it does the Child of God believe that they are powerless. Thus are they
faithless to themself, but strong in faith in their illusions
*about* themself. For faith, perception, and belief *you*
made as means for losing certainty and finding sin. This mad
direction was your choice, and by your faith in what you chose, you
made what you desired.

The Holy Spirit has a use
for all the means for sin by which you sought to find it. But as He
uses them, they lead *away* from sin because His purpose lies in
the opposite direction. He sees the *means* you use but not the
*purpose* for which you made them. He would not take them from
you, for He sees their value as a means for what *He* wills for
you. You made perception that you might choose among your companions
and seek for sin with them. The Holy Spirit sees perception as a
means to teach you that the vision of a holy relationship is all you
*want* to see. Then will you give your faith to holiness,
desiring and believing in it *because* of your desire.

Faith and belief become
attached to vision, as all the means that once served sin are
redirected now toward holiness. For what you think is sin is
*limitation*, and whom you try to limit to the body you hate
because you fear. In your refusal to forgive them, you would condemn
them to the body because the means for sin are dear to you. And so the
body has your faith and your belief. But holiness would set your
companion free, removing hatred by removing fear, not as a symptom, but
at its source.

Those who would free their companions from the body can *have* no fear. 
They have renounced the means for sin by choosing to let all limitations be 
removed. Desiring to look upon their companions in holiness, the power of 
belief and faith goes far beyond the body, *supporting* vision, not 
obstructing it. But first they chose to recognise how much their 
faith had limited their understanding of the world, desiring to place 
its power elsewhere should another point of view be given them. The 
miracles which follow this decision are also born of faith. For all 
who choose to look away from sin are given vision and are led to 
holiness.

Those who believe in sin
*must* think the Holy Spirit asks for sacrifice, for this is how
they think *their* purpose is accomplished. Friends, the Holy
Spirit knows that sacrifice brings *nothing*. He makes no
bargains. And if you seek to limit Him, you will hate Him because you
are afraid. The gift that He has given you is more than anything that
stands this side of Heaven. The instant for its recognition is at
hand. Join your awareness to what has been *already* joined. The
faith you give each other can accomplish this. For He Who loves the
world is seeing it for you without one spot of sin upon it and in the
innocence which makes the sight of it as beautiful as Heaven.

Your faith in sacrifice
has given it great power in your sight, except you do not realise you
cannot see *because* of it. For sacrifice must be exacted of a
body and by another body. The mind could neither ask it nor receive
it of itself. And no more could the body. The intention is in the
mind, which tries to use the body to carry out the means for sin in
which the *mind* believes. Thus is the joining of mind and body
an inescapable belief of those who value sin. And so is sacrifice
invariably a means for limitation and thus for hate.

Think you the Holy Spirit
is concerned with *this*? He gives not what it is His purpose to
lead you *from*. You think He would deprive you for your good.
But “good” and “deprivation” are opposites and
cannot meaningfully join in any way. It is like saying that the moon
and sun are one because they come with night and day, and so they
*must* be joined. Yet sight of one is but the sign the other has
disappeared from sight. Nor is it possible that what gives light be
one with what depends on darkness to be seen. Neither demands the
sacrifice of the other. Yet on the *absence* of the other does
each depend.

The body was made to be a
sacrifice to sin, and in the darkness so it still is seen. Yet in the
light of vision, it is looked upon quite differently. You *can*
have faith in it to serve the Holy Spirit’s goal and give it
power to serve as means to help the blind to see. But in their
seeing, they look *past* it, as do you. The faith and the belief
you gave it *belongs* beyond. You gave perception and belief and
faith from mind to body. Let them now be given back to what produced
them and can use them still to save itself from what it
made.
