The ego is an ally of time,
but not a friend. For it is as mistrustful of death as it is of life,
and what it wants for you it cannot tolerate. The ego wants
*you* dead, but *not* itself. The outcome of its strange
religion must therefore be the conviction that it can pursue you
beyond the grave. And out of its unwillingness for you to find peace
even in the death it wants for you, it offers you immortality in
hell. It speaks to you of Heaven but assures you that Heaven is not
for you. How can the guilty hope for Heaven? The belief in hell is
inescapable to those who identify with the ego. Their nightmares and
their fears are all associated with it.

The ego teaches that hell
is in the *future*, for this is what all its teaching is
directed to. Hell is its *goal*, for although the ego aims at
death and dissolution as an end, it does not *believe* it. The
goal of death, which it craves for you, leaves it unsatisfied. No one
who follows the ego’s teaching is without the fear of death. Yet
if death were thought of merely as an end to pain, would it be
*feared*? We have seen this strange paradox in the ego’s
thought system before, but never so clearly as here. For the ego must
seem to *keep* fear from you to keep your allegiance. Yet it
must *engender* fear in order to maintain *itself*.

Again the ego tries and all
too frequently succeeds in doing both by using dissociation for
holding its contradictory aims together so that they *seem* to
be reconciled. The ego teaches thus: Death is the end as far as hope
of Heaven goes. Yet because you and itself cannot be separated, and
because it cannot conceive of its *own* death, it will pursue
you still because guilt is eternal. Such is the ego’s version of
immortality. And it is this the ego’s version of time
supports.

The ego teaches that Heaven
is here and now because the *future* is hell. Even when it
attacks so savagely that it tries to take the life of someone who
hears it temporarily as the *only* voice, it speaks of hell even
to them. For it tells them hell is *here* and bids them leap from
hell into oblivion. The only time the ego allows anyone to look upon
with some amount of equanimity is the past. And even there its only
value is that it is no more.

How bleak and despairing is
the ego’s use of time! And how terrifying! For underneath its
fanatical insistence that the past and future be the same is hidden a
far more insidious threat to peace. The ego does not advertise its
final threat, for it would have its worshipers still believe that it
can offer the *escape* from it. But the belief in guilt
*must* lead to the belief in hell, *and* *always
does*. The only way in which the ego allows the fear of hell to be
experienced is to bring hell *here,* but always as a foretaste
of the future. For no one who considers themself as deserving hell can
believe that punishment will end in peace.

The Holy Spirit teaches
thus: There *is* no hell. Hell is only what the ego has made of
the *present.* The belief in hell is what prevents you from
*understanding* the present, because you are *afraid* of
it. The Holy Spirit leads as steadily to Heaven as the ego drives to
hell. For the Holy Spirit, Who knows *only* the present, uses it
to undo the fear by which the ego would make the present useless.
There is *no* escape from fear in the ego’s use of time. For
time, according to its teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for
*compounding* guilt until it becomes all-encompassing and
demands vengeance forever.

The Holy Spirit would undo
all of this *now*. Fear is *not* of the present but only of
the past and future, which do not exist. There is no fear in the
present when each instant stands clear and separated from the past,
without its shadow reaching out into the future. Each instant is a
clean, untarnished birth, in which the Child of God emerges from the
past into the present. And the present extends forever. It is so
beautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness
is there. No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are
*now*.

This lesson takes
*no* time. For what is time without a past and future? It
*has* taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes no
time at all to be what you *are.* Begin to practice the Holy
Spirit’s use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace.
Take this very instant, *now*, and think of it as *all there
is* of time. Nothing can reach you here out of the past, and it is
here that you are *completely* absolved, *completely* free,
and *wholly* without condemnation. From this holy instant
wherein holiness was born again, you will go forth in time without
fear and with no sense of change *with* time.

Time is inconceivable
without change, yet holiness does not change. Learn from this instant
more than merely hell does not exist. In this redeeming instant lies
Heaven. And Heaven will not change, for the birth into the holy
present is *salvation* from change. Change is an illusion,
taught by those who could not see themselves as guiltless. There is
no change in Heaven because there is no change in God. In the holy
instant in which you see yourself as bright with freedom, you
*will* remember God. For remembering Her *is* to remember
freedom.

Whenever you are tempted
to be dispirited by the thought of how long it would take to change
your mind so completely, ask yourself, “How long is an
instant?”. Could you not give so short a time to the Holy Spirit
for your salvation? He asks no more, for He has no need of more. It
takes far longer to teach you how to be willing to give Him this than
for Him to use this tiny instant to offer you the whole of Heaven. In
exchange for this instant, He stands ready to give you the
remembrance of eternity.

You will never give this
holy instant to the Holy Spirit on behalf of your release while you
are unwilling to give it to your companions on behalf of *theirs.*
For the instant of holiness is shared, and cannot be yours alone.
Remember, then, when you are tempted to attack a companion, that *their*
instant of release is *yours*. Miracles are the instants of
release you offer and will *receive*. They attest to your
willingness to *be* released and to offer time to the Holy
Spirit for His use of it. How long is an instant? It is as short for
your companion as it is for you. Practice giving this blessed instant
of freedom to all who are enslaved by time and thus make time their
friend *for* them. The Holy Spirit gives their blessed instant
to *you* through your giving it. As you give it, He offers it to
*you*.

Be not unwilling to give
what you would receive of Him, for you join with Him in giving. In
the crystal cleanness of the release you give is your
*instantaneous* escape from guilt. You *must* be holy if
you offer holiness. How long is an instant? As long as it takes to
reestablish perfect sanity, perfect peace, and perfect love for
everyone, for God, and for *yourself*. As long as it takes to
remember immortality and your immortal creations who share it with
you. As long as it takes to exchange hell for Heaven. Long enough to
transcend all of the ego’s making and ascend unto your
Mother.

Time is your friend if you
leave it to the Holy Spirit to use. He needs but very little to
restore God’s whole power to you. He Who transcends time for you
understands what time is *for*. Holiness lies not in time but in
eternity. There never was an instant in which God’s Child could
lose their purity. Their changeless state is beyond time, for their purity
remains forever beyond attack and without variability. Time stands
still in their holiness and changes not. And so it is no longer time at
all. For, caught in the single instant of the eternal sanctity of
God’s creation, it is transformed into forever. *Give* the
eternal instant that eternity may be remembered *for* you in
that shining instant of perfect release. Offer the miracle of the
holy instant through the Holy Spirit and leave His giving it to you
to Him.
