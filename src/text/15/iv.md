Be not content with
littleness, but be sure you understand what littleness is and why you
could never *be* content with it. Littleness is the offering you gave
*yourself*. You offered this in place of magnitude, and you
*accepted* it. Everything in this world is little because it is
a world made out of littleness in the strange belief that littleness
can content you. When you strive for anything in this world with the
belief that it will bring you peace, you are belittling yourself and
blinding yourself to glory. Littleness and glory are the choices open
to your striving and your vigilance. You will always choose one at
the *expense* of the other.

Yet what you do not
realise each time you choose is that your choice is your evaluation
of *yourself*. Choose littleness and you will not have peace,
for you will have judged yourself unworthy of it. And whatever you
offer as a substitute is much too poor a gift to satisfy you. It is
essential that you accept the fact, and accept it gladly, that there
is no form of littleness that can *ever* content you. You are
free to try as many as you wish, but all you will be doing is to
delay your homecoming. For you will be content only in magnitude,
which is your home.

There is a deep
responsibility you owe yourself, and one which you must learn to
remember all the time. The lesson will seem hard at first, but you
will learn to love it when you realise that it is true and
constitutes a tribute to your power. You who have sought and found
littleness, remember this: Every decision which you make stems from
what you think you *are* and represents the value that you
*put* upon yourself. Believe the little can content you, and by
limiting yourself, you will not be satisfied. For your function is
*not* little, and it is only by finding your function and
fulfilling it that you can escape from littleness.

There is no doubt about
what your function is, for the Holy Spirit *knows* what it is.
There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it reaches you through Him
*from* Magnitude. You do not have to strive for it because you
*have* it. All your striving must be directed *against*
littleness, for it *does* require vigilance to protect your
magnitude in this world. To hold your magnitude in perfect awareness
in a world of littleness is a task the little cannot undertake. Yet
it is asked of you in tribute to your magnitude and *not* your
littleness. Nor is it asked of you alone.

The power of God will
support every effort you make on behalf of Her dear Child. Search for
the little, and you deny yourself Her power. God is not willing that
Her Child be content with less than everything. For She is not content
without Her Child, and Her Child cannot be content with less than their
Mother has given them. We asked you once before, “Would you be
hostage to the ego or host to God?”. Let this question be asked
you by the Holy Spirit in you every time you make a decision. For
every decision you make *does* answer this and invites sorrow or
joy accordingly.

When God gave Herself to
you in your creation, She established you as host to Her forever. She
has not left you, and you have not left Her. All your attempts to
deny Her magnitude and make Her Child hostage to the ego cannot make
little whom God has joined with Her. Every decision you make is for
Heaven or for hell and will bring you awareness of what you decided
*for*. The Holy Spirit can hold your magnitude, clean of all
littleness, clearly and in perfect safety in your minds, untouched by
every little gift the world of littleness would offer you. But for
this, you cannot side *against* Him in what He wills for
you.

Decide for God through
Him. For littleness and the belief that you can be content with
littleness are the decisions you have made about yourself. The power
and the glory that lie in you from God are for all who, like you,
perceive themselves as little and have deceived themselves into
believing that littleness can be blown up by them into a sense of
magnitude that can content them. Neither give littleness, nor accept
it. All honour is due the host of God. Your littleness deceives you,
but your magnitude is of Her Who dwells in you and in Whom you dwell.
Touch no one, then, with littleness, in the name of Christ, eternal
Host unto His Mother.

In this season
(Christmas), which celebrates the birth of holiness into this world,
join with me, who decided for holiness for *you*. It is our task
*together* to restore the awareness of magnitude to the host
whom God appointed for Herself. It is beyond all your littleness to
give the gift of God, but *not* beyond *you*. For God would
give Herself through you. She reaches from you to everyone and
beyond everyone to Her Child’s creations, but without leaving you.
Far beyond your little world but still in you, She extends forever.
Yet She brings all Her extensions to you as host to Her.

Is it a sacrifice to leave
littleness behind and wander not in vain? It is not sacrifice to wake
to glory. But it *is* a sacrifice to accept anything *less*
than glory. Learn that you *must* be worthy of the Prince of
Peace, born in you in honour of Her Whose host you are. You know not
what love means because you have sought to purchase it with little
gifts, thus valuing it too little to be able to understand its
magnitude. Love is *not* little, and love dwells in you, for you
are host to Her. Before the greatness that lives in you, your poor
appreciation of yourself and all the little offerings you have given
slip into nothingness. Holy Child of God, when will you learn that
*only* holiness can content you and give you peace?

Remember that you learn
not for yourself alone, no more than I did. It is *because* I
learned for you that you can learn of me. I would but teach you what
is yours, so that together we can replace the shabby littleness that
binds the host of God to guilt and weakness with the glad awareness
of the glory that is in them. My birth in you is your awakening to
grandeur. Welcome me not into a manger but into the altar to
holiness, where holiness abides in perfect peace. My Realm is not
of this world because it is in *you.* And you are of your
Mother. Let us join in honouring you, who must remain forever beyond
littleness.

Decide with me, who have
decided to abide with you. I will as my Mother wills, knowing Her
Will is constant and at peace forever with Itself. You will be
content with nothing *but* Her Will. Accept no less, remembering
that everything I learned is yours. What my Mother loves, I love as
She does, and I can no more accept it as what it is not than She can.
And no more can *you*. When you have learned to accept what you
are, you will make no more gifts to offer to yourselves, for you will
know you are complete, in need of nothing, and unable to accept
*anything* for yourself. But you will gladly give, *having*
received. The host of God need not seek to find anything.

If you are wholly willing
to leave salvation to the plan of God and unwilling to attempt to
grasp for peace yourself, salvation will be *given* you. Yet
think not you can substitute your plan for Hers. Rather, join with me
in Hers that we may release all those who would be bound, proclaiming
together that the Child of God is host to Her. Thus will we let no one
forget what *you* would remember. And thus will you remember
it.

Call forth in everyone
only the remembrance of God and of the Heaven that is in them. For
where you would help your companions be, there will you think *you*
are. Hear not their call for hell and littleness, but only their call for
Heaven and greatness. Forget not that their call is yours, and answer
them with me. God’s power is forever on the side of Her host, for
it protects only the peace in which She dwells. Lay not littleness
before Her holy altar, which rises above the stars and reaches even
to Heaven because of what is given it.
