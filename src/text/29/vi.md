There is a place in you
where this whole world has been forgotten, where no memory of sin and
of illusion lingers still. There is a place in you which time has
left, and echoes of eternity are heard. There is a resting place so
still no sound except a hymn to Heaven rises up to gladden God the
Mother and the Child. Where both abide are They remembered, both. And
where They are is Heaven and is peace. Think not that you can change
Their dwelling place. For your Identity abides in Them, and where
They are, forever must *you* be.

The changelessness of
Heaven is in you, so deep within that nothing in this world but
passes by, unnoticed and unseen. The still infinity of endless peace
surrounds you gently in its soft embrace, so strong and quiet,
tranquil in the might of its Creator; nothing can intrude upon the
sacred Child of God within. Here is the role the Holy Spirit gives to
you who wait upon the Child of God and would behold them waken and be
glad. They are a part of you, and you of them because they are their
Mother’s Child and not for any purpose you may see in them. Nothing
is asked of you but to accept the changeless and eternal that abide
in them, for your Identity is there. The peace in you can but be found
in them. And every thought of love you offer them but brings you nearer
to your wakening to peace eternal and to endless joy.

This sacred Child of God is
like yourself  —  the mirror of their Mother’s love for you, the soft
reminder of their Mother’s love by which they were created and which
still abides in them, as it abides in you. Be very still and hear
God’s Voice in them and let It tell you what their function is. He [God’s 
Voice, that is, the Holy Spirit] was created that you might be whole, for only the complete can be a part of God’s completion, Which created you.

There is no gift the
Mother asks of you but that you see in all creation but the shining
glory of Her gift to you. Behold Her Child, Her perfect gift in whom
their Mother shines forever and to whom is all creation given as their [the 
Child’s] own. Because they have it is it given you, and where it lies in them,
behold your peace. The quiet that surrounds you dwells in them, and
from this quiet come the happy dreams in which your hands are joined
in innocence. These are not hands that grasp in dreams of pain. They
hold no sword, for they have left their hold on every vain illusion
of the world. And being empty, they received instead a companion’s
hand in which completion lay.

If you but knew the
glorious goal that lies beyond forgiveness, you would not keep hold
on any thought, however light the touch of evil on it may appear to
be. For you would understand how great the cost of holding anything
God did not give in minds that can direct the hand to bless and lead
God’s Child unto their Mother’s house. Would you not *want*
to be a friend to them, created by their Mother as Her home? If God
esteems them worthy of Herself, would *you* attack them with the
hands of hate? Who would lay bloody hands on Heaven itself and hope
to find its peace? Your companion thinks they holds the hand of death.
Believe them not. But learn instead how blessed are you who can
release them just by offering them yours.

A dream is given you in
which they are your savior, not your enemy in hate. A dream is given you
in which you have forgiven them for all their dreams of death  —  a dream of
hope you share with them instead of dreaming evil separate dreams of
hate. Why does it seem so hard to share this dream? Because unless
the Holy Spirit gives the dream its function, it was made for hate
and will continue in death’s services. Each form it takes in some
way calls for death. And those who serve the lord of death have come
to worship in a separated world, each with their tiny spear and rusted
sword to keep their ancient promises to die.

Such is the core of fear
in every dream that has been kept apart from use by Him Who [the Holy 
Spirit] sees a different function for a dream. When dreams are shared, they lose the function of attack and separation, even though it was for this that
every dream was made. Yet nothing in the world of dreams remains
without the hope of change and betterment, for here is not where
changelessness is found. Let us be glad indeed that this is so and
seek not the eternal in this world. Forgiving dreams are means to
step aside from dreaming of a world outside yourself. And leading
finally beyond all dreams unto the peace of everlasting
life.
