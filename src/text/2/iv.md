You believe that “being afraid” is involuntary, something beyond your  control. Yet I have told you several times that only *constructive* acts should be involuntary. We have said that Christ-control can take over everything that does *not* matter, while Christ-guidance can direct everything that *does* if you so choose. Fear cannot be Christ-controlled, but it *can* be self-controlled. It *prevents* me from controlling it. The
correction is therefore a matter of *your* will because its presence shows that you have raised the *unimportant* to a higher level than it warrants. You have thus brought it under *your* will, where it does not belong. This means that *you* feel responsible for it. The level confusion here is
obvious.

The reason I cannot
control fear for you is that you are attempting to raise to the mind
level the proper content of lower-order reality. I do not foster
level confusion, but *you* can choose to correct it. You would
not tolerate insane *behavior* on your part and would hardly
advance the excuse that you could not help it. Why should you
tolerate insane *thinking*? There is a confusion here which you
would do well to look at clearly. *You* believe that you are
responsible for what you *do* but *not* for what you
*think*. The truth is that you *are* responsible for what
you think because it is only at this level that you *can*
exercise choice.

What you do *comes
from* what you think. You cannot separate yourself from the truth
by "giving" autonomy to behavior. This is controlled by me
automatically as soon as you place what you think under my guidance.
Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your
mind to miscreate or have *not* allowed me to guide it. It is
pointless to believe that controlling the *outcome* of
mis-thought can result in healing. When you are fearful you have
willed wrongly. This is why you feel responsible for it. You must
change your *mind,* not your behavior, and this *is* a
matter of will.

You do not need guidance
*except* at the mind level. Correction belongs *only* at
the level where creation is possible. The term does not mean anything
at the symptom level, where it cannot work. The correction of fear
*is* your responsibility. When you ask for release from fear,
you are implying that it is not. You should ask instead for help in
the conditions which have brought the fear about. These conditions
*always* entail a separated mind willingness. At that level, you
*can* help it. You are much too tolerant of mind wandering, thus
passively condoning its miscreations. The particular result does not
matter, but the fundamental error *does.* The correction is
always the same. Before you will to do anything, ask me if your will
is in accord with mine. If you are sure that it is, there will
*be* no fear.

Fear is always a sign of
strain, which arises whenever the *will* to do conflicts with
*what* you do. This situation arises in two ways:

First, you can will to do
conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively. This
produces conflicted behavior, which is intolerable to yourself
because the part of the will that wants to do something *else*
is outraged. {.ml-12 .mr-12}

Second, you can *behave* as
you think you should but without entirely *willing* to do so.
This produces consistent behavior but entails great strain
*within* the self. {.ml-12 .mr-12}

In both cases, the will and the behavior are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do *not* will. This arouses a sense of coercion, which usually produces rage. The rage then invades the mind and projection in the wrong sense is likely to follow. Depression or anxiety is virtually certain.

Remember that whenever
there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind. Your
will is split, and your behavior inevitably becomes erratic.
Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error from the first
to the second type of strain described above but will not obliterate
the fear. It is possible to reach a state in which you bring your
will under my guidance without much conscious effort, but this
implies habit patterns which you have not developed dependably as
yet. God cannot ask more than you will. The strength to do comes from
your own undivided will to do. There is no strain in doing God's
Will as soon as you recognize that it is also your own.

The lesson here is quite
simple but particularly apt to be overlooked. I will therefore repeat
it, urging you to listen. Only your *mind* can produce fear. It
does so whenever it is conflicted in what it wills, thus producing
inevitable strain because willing and doing become discordant. This
cannot be corrected by better *doing*, but it *can* be
corrected by higher *willing*.
