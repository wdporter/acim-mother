How simple is salvation! All it says is what was never true is not true now and never will be. The impossible has not occurred and can have no effects. And that is all. Can this be hard to learn by anyone who *wants* it to be
true? Only unwillingness to learn it could make such an easy lesson
difficult. How hard is it to see that what is false cannot be true,
and what is true cannot be false? You can no longer say that you
perceive no differences in false and true. You have been told exactly
how to tell one from the other and just what to do if you become
confused. Why then do you persist in learning not such simple
things?

There *is* a reason. But confuse it not with difficulty in the simple things salvation asks you learn. It teaches but the very obvious. It merely goes from
one apparent lesson to the next in easy steps which lead you gently
from one to another with no strain at all. This cannot be confusing,
yet you *are* confused. For somehow you believe that what is
totally confused is easier to learn and understand. What you have
taught yourselves is such a giant learning feat it is indeed
incredible. But you accomplished it because you wanted to and did not
pause in diligence to judge it hard to learn, or too complex to
grasp.

No one who understands what you have learned, how carefully you learned it, and the pains to which you went to practice and repeat the lessons endlessly in every form you could conceive of them could ever doubt the power of your learning skill. There is no greater power in the world. The world was made by it and even now depends on nothing else. The lessons you have taught yourselves have been so overlearned and fixed they rise like heavy curtains to obscure the simple and the obvious. Say not you cannot learn *them*. For your power to learn is strong enough to
teach you that your will is not your own, your thoughts do not belong
to you, and even you are someone else.

Who could maintain that lessons such as these are easy? Yet you have learned more than this. You have continued, taking every step, however difficult, without complaint until a world was built that suited you. And every lesson that makes up the world arises from the first accomplishment of learning — an enormity so great the Holy Spirit’s Voice seems small
and still before its magnitude. The world began with one strange
lesson, powerful enough to render God forgotten and Her Child an alien
to themself, in exile from the home where God Herself established them.
You who have taught yourselves the Child of God is guilty, say not that
you cannot learn the simple things salvation teaches you!

Learning is an ability you made and gave yourselves. It was not made to do the Will of God but to uphold a wish that It could be opposed, and that a will apart from It was yet more real than It. And this has learning sought to
demonstrate, and you have learned what it was made to teach. Now does
your ancient overlearning stand implacable before the Voice of truth
and teach you that Its lessons are not true, too hard to learn, too
difficult to see, and too opposed to what is really true. Yet you
*will* learn them, for their learning is the only purpose for
your learning skill the Holy Spirit sees in all the world. Her simple
lessons in forgiveness have a power mightier than yours because they
call from God and from your Self to you.

Is this a *little* Voice, so small and still It cannot rise above the senseless noise of sounds which have no meaning? God willed not Her Child forget Her. And the power of Her Will is in the Voice that speaks for Her. Which
lesson will you learn? What outcome is inevitable, sure as God, and
far beyond all doubt and question? Can it be your little learning,
strange in outcome and incredible in difficulty, will withstand the
simple lessons being taught to you in every moment of each day, since
time began and learning had been made?

The lessons to be learned are only two. Each has its outcome in a different world. And each world follows surely from its source. The certain outcome of the lesson that God’s Child is guilty is the world you see. It
*is* a world of terror and despair. Nor is there hope of
happiness in it. There is no plan for safety you can make that ever
will succeed. There is no joy that you can seek for here and hope to
find. Yet this is not the only outcome which your learning can
produce. However much you may have overlearned your chosen task, the
lesson which reflects the Love of God is stronger still. And you
*will* learn God’s Child is innocent and see another
world.

The outcome of the lesson that God’s Child is guiltless is a world in which there is no fear and everything is lit with hope and sparkles with a gentle
friendliness. Nothing but calls to you in soft appeal to be your
friend and let it join with you. And never does a call remain
unheard, misunderstood, nor left unanswered in the self-same tongue in
which the call was made. And you will understand it was this call
that everyone and everything within the world has *always* made,
but you had not perceived it as it was. And now you see you were
mistaken. You had been deceived by forms the call was hidden in. And
so you did not hear it and had lost a friend who always wanted to be
part of you. The soft, eternal calling of each part of God’s
creation to the whole is heard throughout the world this second
lesson brings.

There is no living thing which does not share the universal will that it be whole and that you do not leave its call unheard. Without your answer is it left to die, as it is saved from death when you have heard its calling as the
ancient call to life and understood that it is but your own. The
Christ in you remembers God with all the certainty with which He
knows Her Love. But only if Her Child is innocent can She be Love. For
God were fear indeed if they whom She created innocent could be a slave
to guilt. God’s perfect Child remembers their creation. But in guilt
they have forgotten what they really are.

The fear of God results as surely from the lesson that Her Child is guilty as God’s Love must be remembered when they learns their innocence. For hate must mother fear and look upon its mother as itself. How wrong are you who fail to hear the call that echoes past each seeming call to death, that sings behind each murderous attack and pleads that love restore the dying world! You do not understand Who calls to you beyond each form of
hate, each call to war. Yet you will recognize Her as you give Her
answer in the language that She calls. She will appear when you have
answered Her, and you will know in Her that God *is* Love.

What is temptation but a wish to make the wrong decision on what you would learn and have an outcome that you do not want? It is the recognition that it is a state of mind unwanted that becomes the means whereby the choice is reässessed; another outcome seen to be preferred. You are deceived if you believe you want disaster and disunity and pain. Hear not the call for this within yourself. But listen, rather, to the deeper call
beyond it that appeals for peace and joy. And all the world will
*give* you joy and peace. For as you hear, you answer. And
behold! Your answer is the proof of what you learned. Its outcome is
the world you look upon.

Let us be still an instant
and forget all things we ever learned, all thoughts we had, and every
preconception which we hold of what things mean and what their
purpose is. Let us remember not our own ideas of what the world is
for. We do not know. Let every image held of [anyone] be loosened
from our minds and swept away. Be innocent of judgment, unaware of
any thoughts of evil or of good that ever crossed your mind of
anyone. Now do [you] know them not. But you *are* free to learn of
them and learn of them anew. Now are they born again to you, and you are
born again to them without the past that sentenced them to die, and you
with them. Now are they free to live, as you are free because an ancient
learning passed away and left a place for truth to be
reborn.
