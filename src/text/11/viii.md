Miracles demonstrate that
learning has occurred under the right guidance, for learning is
invisible, and what has been learned can be recognized only by its
*results*. Its generalization is demonstrated as you use it in
more and more situations. You will recognize that you have learned
there is no order of difficulty in miracles when you have applied
them to *all* situations. There *is* no situation to which
miracles do not apply, and by applying them to all situations, you
will gain the real world. For in this holy perception, you will be
made whole, and the Atonement will radiate from *your*
acceptance of it for *yourself* to everyone the Holy Spirit
sends you for your blessing. In every Child of God His blessing lies,
and in *your* blessing of the Children of God is His blessing to
*you*.

Everyone in the world must
play their part in the redemption of the world to recognize that the
world *has been* redeemed. You cannot see the invisible. Yet if
you see its effects, you *know* it must be there. By perceiving
what it *does*, you recognize its being. And by *what* it
does, you learn what it *is*. You cannot *see* your
abilities, but you gain confidence in their existence as they enable
you to *act*. And the *results* of your actions you
*can* see.

The Holy Spirit is
invisible, but you can see the *results* of His Presence, and
through them you will learn that He is there. What He enables you to
do is clearly *not* of this world, for miracles violate every
law of reality as this world judges it. Every law of time and space,
of magnitude and mass, of prediction and control is transcended, for
what the Holy Spirit enables you to do is clearly beyond *all*
of them. Perceiving His results, you will understand *where* He
must be and finally *know* what He is.

You cannot see the Holy
Spirit, but you can see His manifestations. And unless you do, you
will not realize He is there. Miracles are His witnesses and speak
for His Presence. What you cannot see becomes real to you only
through the witnesses who speak for it. For you can be *aware*
of what you cannot see, and it can become compellingly real to you as
its presence becomes manifest *through* you. Do the Holy
Spirit’s work, for you *share* in His function. As your
function in Heaven is creation, so your function on earth is healing.
God shares Her function with you in Heaven, and the Holy Spirit
shares His with you on earth.

As long as you believe you
have two functions, so long will you need correction. For this belief
is the *destruction* of peace, a goal in direct opposition to
the Holy Spirit’s purpose. You see what you *expect,* and
you expect what you *invite*. Your perception is the result of
your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it. Whose
manifestations would you see? Of whose presence would you be
convinced? For you will believe in what you *manifest*, and as
you look out, so will you see in. Two ways of looking at the world
are in your mind, and your perception will reflect the guidance you
chose.

I am the manifestation of
the Holy Spirit, and when you see me, it will be because you have
invited Him. For He *will* send you His witnesses if you will
but look upon them. Remember always that you see what you seek, for
what you seek you *will* find. The ego finds what *it*
seeks and *only* that. It does not find love, for that is
*not* what it is seeking. Yet seeking and finding are the same,
and if you seek for two goals you will find them, but you will
*recognize neither*. For you will think they are the same
because you *want* them both. The mind always strives for
integration, and if it is split and wants to *keep* the split,
it will believe it has one goal by *making* it one.

We said before that
*what* you project is up to you, but it is *not* up to you
*whether* to project, for projection is a law of mind.
Perception *is* projection, and you look in *before* you
look out. As you look in you choose the guide for seeing, and
*then* you look out and behold their witnesses. This is *why*
you find what you seek. What you want in *yourself*, you will
make manifest by projection, and you will accept it *from* the
world because you put it there *by* wanting it.

When you think you are
projecting what you do *not* want, it is still because you
*do* want it. This leads directly to dissociation, for it
represents the acceptance of two goals, each perceived in a
*different* place, separated from each other *because* you
made them different. The mind then sees a divided world
*outside* itself but not *within*. This gives it an
illusion of integrity and enables it to believe that it is pursuing
one goal. As long as you perceive the world as split, *you* are
not healed. For to be healed is to pursue one goal because you have
*accepted* only one and *want* but one.

When you want *only*
love you will see nothing else. The contradictory nature of the
witnesses you perceive is merely the reflection of your conflicting
invitations. You have looked upon your minds and accepted opposition
there, having *sought* it there. But do not then believe that
the witnesses for opposition are true, for they attest only to
*your* decision about reality, returning to you the message you
*gave* them. Love is recognized by its messengers. If you make
love manifest, its messengers will come to you because you
*invited* them.

The power of decision is
your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of this world. *You can
decide to see it right*. What *you* made of it is *not*
its reality, for its reality is only what you *gave* it. You
cannot really give anything but love to anyone or anything, nor can
you really *receive* anything else from them. If you think you
have received anything else, it is because you have looked within and
thought you saw the power to give something else *within
yourself*. It was only this decision that determined what you
found, for it was the decision of what you *sought*.

You are afraid of me
because you looked within and are afraid of what you saw. Yet you
could not have seen reality, for the reality of your mind is the
loveliest of God’s creations. Coming only from God, its power and
grandeur could only bring you peace *if you really looked upon
it.* If you are afraid, it is because you saw something *that is
not there*. Yet in that same place, you could have looked upon me
and all your companions in the perfect safety of the Mind which created
us. For we are there in the peace of the Mother, Who wills to project
Her peace through *you*.

When you have accepted
your mission to *project* peace, you will *find* it, for by
*making it manifest*, you will *see* it. Its holy witnesses
will surround you because you *called* upon them and they will
come to you. I have heard your call and I have answered it, but you
will not look upon me nor *hear* the answer which you sought.
That is because you do not yet want *only* that. Yet as I become
more real to you, you will learn that you *do* want only that.
And you will see me as you look within, and we will look upon the
world as God created it together. Through the eyes of Christ,
*only* the real world exists and can *be* seen. As you
decide, so will you see. And all that you see but witnesses to your
decision.

When you look within and
see me, it will be because you have decided to manifest truth. And as
you manifest it, you will see it both without *and* within, for
you will see it without *because* you saw it first within.
Everything you behold without is a judgment of what you beheld
within. If it is *your* judgment, it will be wrong, for judgment
is not your function. If it is the judgment of the Holy Spirit, it
will be right, for judgment *is* His function. You share His
function only by judging as *He* does, reserving no judgment at
all unto yourselves. For you will judge *against* yourselves,
but *He* will judge *for* you.

Remember, then, that
whenever you look without and react unfavorably to what you see, you
have judged yourself unworthy and have condemned yourself to death.
The death penalty is the ego’s ultimate goal, for it fully
believes that you are a criminal, as deserving of death as God knows
you are deserving of life. The death penalty never leaves the
ego’s mind, for that is what it always reserves for you in the
end. Wanting to kill you as the final expression of its feeling for
you, it lets you live but to await death. It will torment you while
you live, but its hatred is not satisfied until you die. For your
destruction is the one end toward which it works, and the only end
with which it will be satisfied.

The ego is not a traitor
to God to Whom treachery is impossible, but it *is* a traitor to
you who believe *you* have been treacherous to your Mother. That
is why the *undoing* of guilt is an essential part of the Holy
Spirit’s teaching. For as long as you feel guilty, you are
listening to the voice of the ego, which tells you that you
*have* been treacherous to God and therefore *deserve*
death. You will think that death comes from God and *not* from
the ego because, by confusing yourself *with* the ego, you
believe that *you* want death. And from what you want, God does
*not* save you.

When you are tempted to
yield to the desire for death, *remember that I did not die*.
You will realize that this is true when you look within and
*see* me. Would I have overcome death for myself alone? And
would eternal life have been given me of the Mother *unless* She
had also given it to you? When you learn to make *me* manifest,
*you* will never see death. For you will have looked upon the
deathless in *yourself*, and you will see only the eternal as
you look out upon a world that *cannot* die.
