Only love is strong
because it is *undivided*. The strong do not attack because they
see no need to do so. *Before* the idea of attack can enter your
mind, you must have *perceived* yourself as weak. Because you
had attacked yourself and believed that the attack was
*effective*, you behold yourself as weakened. No longer
perceiving yourself and all your companions as equal and regarding
yourself as *weaker*, you attempt to “equalize” the
situation *you* have made. You use attack to do so because you
believe that attack was successful in weakening *you*.

That is why the recognition of your *own* invulnerability is so important in the
restoration of your sanity. For if you accept your invulnerability,
you are recognising that attack *has* no effect. Although you
have attacked yourself, and very brutally, you will demonstrate that
*nothing happened*. Therefore, by attacking you have not done
*anything*. Once you realise this, there is no longer any
*sense* in attack, for it manifestly *does not work* and
*cannot* protect you. Yet the recognition of your
invulnerability has more than negative value. If your attacks on
yourself have *failed* to weaken you, *you are still
strong*. You therefore have no need to “equalize” the
situation to establish your strength.

You will never realise the utter uselessness of attack *except* by recognising 
that your attack on *yourself* had no effects. For others *do* react
to attack if they perceive it, and if you are trying to attack
*them*, you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as
reinforcement. The *only* place where you can cancel out all
reinforcement is in *yourself*. For *you* are always the
first point of your attack, and if *this* has never been, it
*has* no consequences.

The Holy Spirit’s love
is your strength, for yours is divided and therefore not real. You
could not trust your own love when you have *attacked* it. You
cannot learn of perfect love with a split mind because a split mind
has *made* itself a poor learner. You tried to make the
separation eternal because you wanted to retain the characteristics
of creation with your own *content*. Yet creation is *not*
of you, and poor learners need special teaching. You have learning
handicaps in a very literal sense.

There are areas in your
learning skills which are so impaired that you can progress only
under constant, clear-cut direction provided by a Teacher Who can
*transcend* your limited resources. He *becomes* your
resource because, of *yourself*, you *cannot* learn. The
learning situation in which you placed yourself *is* impossible,
and in this situation you clearly require a special Teacher and a
special curriculum. Poor learners are not good choices for teachers,
either for themselves or for anyone else. You would hardly turn to
*them* to establish the curriculum by which they can
*escape* from their limitations. If they understood what is
beyond them, they would not *be* handicapped.

You do not know the
meaning of love, and that *is* your handicap. Do not attempt to
teach yourselves what you do not understand, and do not try to set up
curriculum goals where yours have clearly failed. *Your*
learning goal has been *not* to learn, and this *cannot*
lead to successful learning. You cannot transfer what you have not
learned, and the impairment of the ability to generalize is a crucial
learning failure. Would you ask those who have *failed* to learn
what learning aids are *for? They do not know*. For if they
could interpret the aids correctly, they would have learned from
them.

We have said that the
ego’s rule is, “Seek and do *not* find”.
Translated into curricular terms, this is the same as saying,
“*Try* to learn but do *not* succeed”. The result
of this curriculum goal is obvious. Every legitimate teaching aid,
every real instruction, and every sensible guide to learning *will
be misinterpreted*. For they are all for learning facilitation,
which this strange curriculum goal is *against*. If you are
trying to learn how *not* to learn and are using the aim of
teaching to *defeat* itself, what can you expect *but*
confusion? The curriculum does not make *sense*.

This kind of
“learning” has so weakened your mind that you *cannot*
love, for the curriculum you have chosen is *against* love and
amounts to a course in *how to attack yourself*. A necessary
minor, supplementing this major curriculum goal, is learning how
*not* to overcome the split which made this goal believable. And
you can *not* overcome it, for all *your* learning is on
its *behalf*. Yet your will speaks against your learning, as
your learning speaks against your will, and so you fight
*against* learning and succeed, for that *is* your will.
But you do not realise even yet that there *is* something you
*do* will to learn, and that you can learn it because it
*is* your will to do so.

You who have tried to
learn what you do *not* will should take heart, for although the
curriculum you set yourself is depressing indeed, it is merely
ridiculous if you look at it. Is it *possible* that the way to
achieve a goal is *not* to attain it? Resign *now* as your
own teachers. *This* resignation will *not* lead to
depression. It is merely the result of an honest appraisal of what
you have taught yourselves and of the learning outcomes which have
resulted. Under the proper learning conditions, which you can neither
provide nor understand, you will become excellent learners *and*
teachers. But it is not so yet and will not *be* so until the
whole learning situation as *you* have set it up is
reversed.

Your learning
*potential*, properly understood, is limitless because it will
lead you to God. You can *teach* the way to Her *and* learn
it if you follow the Teacher Who knows it and His curriculum for
learning it. The curriculum is totally unambiguous because the goal
is *not* divided, and the means and the end are in
*complete* accord. You need offer only *undivided
attention*. Everything else will be *given* you. For it is
*your* will to learn aright, and nothing can oppose the will of
God’s Child. Their learning is as unlimited as *they* are.
