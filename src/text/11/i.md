You have been told not
to make error real, and the way to do this is very simple. If you
*want* to believe in error, you would *have* to make it
real, because it is not true. But truth is real in its own right, and
to believe in truth, *you do not have to do anything*.
Understand that you do not respond to stimuli, but to stimuli *as
you interpret them*. Your interpretation thus becomes the
justification for the response. That is why analyzing the motives of
others is hazardous to *you*. If you decide that someone is
really trying to attack you or desert you or enslave you, you will
respond *as if* they had actually done so, because you have made
their error *real* to you. To interpret error is to give it power,
and having done this, you *will* overlook truth.

The analysis of
ego-motivation is very complicated, very obscuring, and *never*
without the risk of your own ego-involvement. The whole process
represents a clear-cut attempt to demonstrate your *own* ability
to understand what you perceive. This is shown by the fact that you
react to your interpretations *as if* they were correct and
control your reactions behaviorally but not emotionally. This is
quite evidently a mental split in which you have attacked the
integrity of your mind and pitted one level within it against
another.
