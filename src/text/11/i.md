You have learned your need of healing. Would you bring anything else to the 
Sonship, recognising your need of healing for yourself? For in this lies the 
beginning of the return to knowledge; the foundation on which God will help 
build again the thought system you share with Her. Not one stone you place 
upon it but will be blessed by Her, for you will be restoring the holy 
dwelling place of Her Son, where She wills Her Son to be and where he is. In 
whatever part of the mind of God’s Son you restore this reality, you restore 
it to yourself. You dwell in the Mind of God with your companion, for God 
Herself did not will to be alone.

To be alone is to be separated from infinity, but how can this be if infinity 
has no end? No one can be beyond the limitless, because what has no limits 
must be everywhere. There are no beginnings and no endings in God, Whose 
universe is Herself. Can you exclude yourself from the universe, or from God 
Who _is_ the universe? I and my Mother are one with you, for you are part of 
Us. Do you really believe that part of God can be missing or lost to Her? 

If you were not part of God, Her Will would not be unified. Is this 
conceivable? Can part of Her Mind contain nothing? If your place in Her Mind 
cannot be filled by anyone except you, and your filling it was your creation, 
without you there would be an empty place in God’s Mind. Extension cannot be 
blocked, and it has no voids. It continues forever, however much it is denied. 
Your denial of its reality may arrest it in time, but not in eternity. That is 
why your creations have not ceased to be extended, and why so much is waiting 
for your return.

Waiting is possible only in time, but time has no meaning. You who made delay 
can leave time behind simply by recognising that neither beginnings nor 
endings were created by the Eternal, Who placed no limits on Her creation or 
upon those who create like Her. You do not know this simply because you have 
tried to limit what She created, and so you believe that all creation is 
limited. How, then, could you know your creations, having denied infinity? 

The laws of the universe do not permit contradiction. What holds for God holds for you. If you believe you are absent from God, you will believe that She is absent from you. Infinity is meaningless without you, and you are meaningless without God. There is no end to God and Her Son, for we _are_ the universe. God is not incomplete, and She is not childless. Because She did not will to be alone, She created a Son like Herself. Do not deny Her Her Son, for your unwillingness to accept Her Motherhood has denied you yours. See Her creations as Her Son, for yours were created in honour of Her. The universe of love does not stop because you do not see it, nor have your closed eyes lost the ability to see. Look upon the glory of His creation, and you will learn what God has kept for you.

God has given you a place in Her Mind that is yours forever. Yet you can keep 
it only by giving it, as it was given you. Could you be alone there, when it 
was given you because God did not will to be alone? God’s Mind cannot be 
lessened. It can only be increased, for everything She creates has the function 
of creating. Love does not limit, and what it creates is not limited. To give 
without limit is God’s Will for you, because only this can bring you the joy 
that is Hers and that She wills to share with you. Your love is as boundless as 
Hers because it _is_ Hers.

Could any part of God be without Her Love, and could any part of Her Love be 
contained? God is your heritage, because Her one gift is Herself. How can you 
give except like Her if you would know Her gift to you? Give, then, without 
limit and without end, to learn how much She has given you. Your ability to 
accept Her depends on your willingness to give as She gives. Your motherhood 
and your Mother are one. God wills to create, and your will is Hers. It 
follows, then, that you will to create, since your will follows from Hers. And 
being an extension of Her Will, yours must be the same.

Yet what you will you do not know. This is not strange when you realise that to deny is to “not know”. God’s Will is that you are Her Son. By denying this you deny your own will, and therefore do not know what it is. You must ask what God’s Will is in everything, because it is yours. You do not know what it is, but the Holy Spirit remembers it for you. Ask Him, therefore, what God’s Will is for you, and He will tell you yours. It cannot be too often repeated that you do not know it. Whenever what the Holy Spirit tells you appears to be coercive, it is only because you have not recognised your will.

The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God’s Will is outside 
yourself, and therefore not yours. In this interpretation it seems possible 
for God’s Will and yours to conflict. God, then, may seem to demand of you 
what you do not want to give, and thus deprive you of what you want. Would 
God, Who wants only your will, be capable of this? Your will is Her life, 
which She has given to you. Even in time you cannot live apart from Her. Sleep 
is not death. What She created can sleep, but cannot die. Immortality is Her 
Will for Her Son, and Her Son’s will for himself. God’s Son cannot will death 
for himself because his Mother is life, and Her Son is like Her. Creation is 
your will _because_ it is Hers.

You cannot be happy unless you do what you will truly, and you cannot change 
this because it is immutable. It is immutable by God’s Will and yours, for 
otherwise Her Will would not be extended. You are afraid to know God’s Will, 
because you believe it is not yours. This belief is your whole sickness and 
your whole fear. Every symptom of sickness and fear arises here, because this 
is the belief that makes you _want_ not to know. Believing this you hide in 
darkness, denying that the light is in you.

You are asked to trust the Holy Spirit only because He speaks for you. He is the Voice for God, but never forget that God did not will to be alone. She shares Her Will with you; She does not thrust it upon you. Always remember that what She gives She keeps, so that nothing She gives can contradict Her. You who share Her life must share it to know it, for sharing _is_ knowing. Blessed are you who learn that to hear the Will of your Mother is to know your own. For it is your will to be like Her, Whose Will it is that it be so. God’s Will is that Her Son be one, and united with Her in Her Oneness. That is why healing is the beginning of the recognition that your will is Hers. <acim-org-link pagenumber={{pageNumber}} reference={{reference}}></acim-org-link>
