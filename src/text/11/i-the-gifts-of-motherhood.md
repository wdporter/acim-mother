You have learned your need of healing. Would you bring anything else to the 
Sonship, recognising your need of healing for yourself? For in this lies the 
beginning of the return to knowledge; the foundation on which God will help 
build again the thought system you share with Her. Not one stone you place 
upon it but will be blessed by Her, for you will be restoring the holy 
dwelling place of Her Son, where She wills Her Son to be and where he is. In 
whatever part of the mind of God’s Son you restore this reality, you restore 
it to yourself. You dwell in the Mind of God with your companion, for God 
Herself did not will to be alone.

To be alone is to be separated from infinity, but how can this be if infinity 
has no end? No one can be beyond the limitless, because what has no limits 
must be everywhere. There are no beginnings and no endings in God, Whose 
universe is Herself. Can you exclude yourself from the universe, or from God 
Who _is_ the universe? I and my Mother are one with you, for you are part of 
Us. Do you really believe that part of God can be missing or lost to Her? 

If you were not part of God, Her Will would not be unified. Is this 
conceivable? Can part of Her Mind contain nothing? If your place in Her Mind 
cannot be filled by anyone except you, and your filling it was your creation, 
without you there would be an empty place in God’s Mind. Extension cannot be 
blocked, and it has no voids. It continues forever, however much it is denied. 
Your denial of its reality may arrest it in time, but not in eternity. That is 
why your creations have not ceased to be extended, and why so much is waiting 
for your return.

4. Waiting is possible only in time, but time has no meaning. You who made delay can leave time behind simply by recognizing that neither beginnings nor endings were created by the Eternal, Who placed no limits on His creation or upon those who create like Him. You do not know this simply because you have tried to limit what He created, and so you believe that all creation is limited. How, then, could you know your creations, having denied infinity?

5. The laws of the universe do not permit contradiction. What holds for God holds for you. If you believe you are absent from God, you will believe that He is absent from you. Infinity is meaningless without you, and you are meaningless without God. There is no end to God and His Son, for we _are_ the universe. God is not incomplete, and He is not childless. Because He did not will to be alone, He created a Son like Himself. Do not deny Him His Son, for your unwillingness to accept His Fatherhood has denied you yours. See His creations as His Son, for yours were created in honor of Him. The universe of love does not stop because you do not see it, nor have your closed eyes lost the ability to see. Look upon the glory of His creation, and you will learn what God has kept for you.

6. God has given you a place in His Mind that is yours forever. Yet you can keep it only by giving it, as it was given you. Could you be alone there, when it was given you because God did not will to be alone? God’s Mind cannot be lessened. It can only be increased, for everything He creates has the function of creating. Love does not limit, and what it creates is not limited. To give without limit is God’s Will for you, because only this can bring you the joy that is His and that He wills to share with you. Your love is as boundless as His because it _is_ His.

7. Could any part of God be without His Love, and could any part of His Love be contained? God is your heritage, because His one gift is Himself. How can you give except like Him if you would know His gift to you? Give, then, without limit and without end, to learn how much He has given you. Your ability to accept Him depends on your willingness to give as He gives. Your fatherhood and your Father are one. God wills to create, and your will is His. It follows, then, that you will to create, since your will follows from His. And being an extension of His Will, yours must be the same.

8. Yet what you will you do not know. This is not strange when you realize that to deny is to “not know.” God’s Will is that you are His Son. By denying this you deny your own will, and therefore do not know what it is. You must ask what God’s Will is in everything, because it is yours. You do not know what it is, but the Holy Spirit remembers it for you. Ask Him, therefore, what God’s Will is for you, and He will tell you yours. It cannot be too often repeated that you do not know it. Whenever what the Holy Spirit tells you appears to be coercive, it is only because you have not recognized your will.

9. The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God’s Will is outside yourself, and therefore not yours. In this interpretation it seems possible for God’s Will and yours to conflict. God, then, may seem to demand of you what you do not want to give, and thus deprive you of what you want. Would God, Who wants only your will, be capable of this? Your will is His life, which He has given to you. Even in time you cannot live apart from Him. Sleep is not death. What He created can sleep, but cannot die. Immortality is His Will for His Son, and His Son’s will for himself. God’s Son cannot will death for himself because his Father is life, and His Son is like Him. Creation is your will _because_ it is His.

10. You cannot be happy unless you do what you will truly, and you cannot change this because it is immutable. It is immutable by God’s Will and yours, for otherwise His Will would not be extended. You are afraid to know God’s Will, because you believe it is not yours. This belief is your whole sickness and your whole fear. Every symptom of sickness and fear arises here, because this is the belief that makes you _want_ not to know. Believing this you hide in darkness, denying that the light is in you.

11. You are asked to trust the Holy Spirit only because He speaks for you. He is the Voice for God, but never forget that God did not will to be alone. He shares His Will with you; He does not thrust it upon you. Always remember that what He gives He keeps, so that nothing He gives can contradict Him. You who share His life must share it to know it, for sharing _is_ knowing. Blessed are you who learn that to hear the Will of your Father is to know your own. For it is your will to be like Him, Whose Will it is that it be so. God’s Will is that His Son be one, and united with Him in His Oneness. That is why healing is the beginning of the recognition that your will is His. (https://acim.org/acim/en/s/146#3:1-11:9 | T-11.I.3:1–11:9)
