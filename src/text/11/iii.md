Fear is a symptom of your
deep sense of loss. If when you perceive it in others you learn to
*supply* the loss, the basic *cause* of fear is removed.
Thereby you teach yourself that fear does not exist *in you*,
for you have *in yourself* the means for removing it and have
demonstrated this by *giving* it. Fear and love are the only
emotions of which you are capable. One is false, for it was made out
of denial, and denial depends on the real belief in what is denied
for its *own* existence.

By interpreting fear correctly *as a positive affirmation of the underlying belief it masks*, you are undermining its perceived usefulness by rendering it useless. Defences which do not work at all are *automatically* discarded. If you raise what fear conceals to *clear-cut, unequivocal predominance*, fear becomes meaningless. You have denied its power to conceal love, which was its only purpose. The mask which *you* have drawn across the face of love has disappeared.

If you would look upon love, which *is* the world’s reality, how could you do better than to recognise in every defence *against* it the underlying appeal *for* it? And how could you better learn of its reality than by answering the appeal for it by *giving* it? The Holy Spirit’s interpretation of fear *does* dispel it, for the *awareness* of truth cannot *be* denied. Thus does the Holy Spirit replace fear with love and translate error into truth. And thus will *you* learn of Him how to replace your dream of separation with the fact of unity. For the separation is only the *denial* of union and, correctly interpreted, attests to your eternal knowledge that union is true.

Miracles are merely the
translation of denial into truth. If to love oneself is to
*heal* oneself, those who are sick do *not* love
themselves. Therefore, they are asking for the love that would heal
them but which they are denying to themselves. If they knew the truth
about themselves, they could not *be* sick. The task of the
miracle-worker thus becomes *to deny the denial of truth*. The
sick must heal *themselves*, for the truth is in them. Yet,
having *obscured* it, the light in *another* mind must
shine into theirs because that light *is* theirs.

The light in them shines
as brightly, *regardless* of the density of the fog that
obscures it. If *you* give no power to the fog to obscure the
light, it *has* none, for it has power only because the Child of
God gave power to it. They must *themself* withdraw that power,
remembering that *all* power is of God. *You can remember this
for all the Family of God*. Do not allow your companions not to remember,
for their forgetfulness is *yours*. But *your* remembering is
*theirs*, for God cannot be remembered alone. *This is what you
have forgotten*. To perceive the healing of your companion as the
healing of yourself is thus the way to remember God. For you forgot
your companions *with* Him, and God’s answer to your
forgetting is but the way to remember.

Perceive in sickness but another call for love and offer your companions what they believe they cannot offer themselves. Whatever the sickness, there is but *one* remedy. You will be made whole as you *make* whole, for to
perceive in sickness the appeal for health is to recognise in hatred
the call for love. And to give a companion what they *really* want
is to offer it unto yourself, for your Mother wills you to know your
companions *as* yourself. Answer *their* call for love and
*yours* is answered. Healing is the love of Christ for His
Mother and for *Himself*.

Remember what we said
about the frightening perceptions of little children which terrify
them because they do not understand them. If they ask for
enlightenment and *accept* it, their fears vanish, but if they
*hide* their nightmares, they will *keep* them. It is easy
to help an uncertain child, for they recognise that they does not know
what their perceptions mean. Yet you believe that you *do* know.
Little children, you are hiding your heads under the covers of the
heavy blankets you have laid upon yourselves. You are hiding your
nightmares in the darkness of your own certainty and refusing to open
your eyes *and look at them*.

Let us not save
nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for Christ, and so
they are not fit gifts for *you*. Take off the covers and look
at what you are afraid of. Only the *anticipation* will frighten
you, for the reality of nothingness cannot *be* frightening. Let
us not delay this, for your dream of hatred will not leave you
without help, and help is here. Learn to be quiet in the midst of
turmoil, for quietness is the end of strife and this is the journey
to peace. Look straight at every image that rises to delay you, for
the goal is inevitable because it is eternal. The goal of love is but
your right, and it belongs to you *despite* your preference.

*You still want what God
wills*, and no nightmare can defeat a Child of God in their purpose.
For your purpose was given you by God, and you must accomplish it
*because* it is Her Will. Awake and remember your purpose, for
it is *your* will to do so. What has been accomplished for you
*must* be yours. Do not let your hatred stand in the way of
love, for *nothing* can withstand the love of Christ for His
Mother or His Mother’s love for Him.

A little while and you
*will* see me, for I am not hidden because *you* are
hiding. I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for I awoke
*for* you. In *my* resurrection is *your* release. Our
mission is to escape *crucifixion*, not redemption. Trust in my
help, for I did not walk alone, and I will walk with you as our
Mother walked with me. Did you not know that I walked with Her in
peace? And does not that mean that peace goes with *us* on the
journey?

There is no fear in
perfect love. We will but be making perfect to you what is
*already* perfect *in* you. You do not fear the
*unknown*, but the *known*. You will not fail in your
mission because I failed not in mine. Give me but a little trust in
the name of the *complete* trust I have in you, and we will
easily accomplish the goal of perfection together. For perfection
*is* and cannot *be* denied. To deny the denial of
perfection is not so difficult as the denial of truth, and what we
can accomplish together *must* be believed when you *see*
it as accomplished.

You who have tried to
banish love have not succeeded, but you who choose to banish fear
*will* succeed. The Lord is with you, but you know it not. Yet
your Redeemer liveth and abideth in you in the peace out of which He
was created. Would you not exchange *this* awareness for the
awareness of your fear? When we have overcome fear — not by hiding it,
not by minimizing it, not by denying its full import in any way — this
*is* what you will really see. You cannot lay aside the obstacle
to real vision without looking upon it, for to lay aside means to
judge *against*. If *you* will look, the Holy Spirit will
judge and will judge truly. He cannot shine away what *you* keep
hidden, for you have not offered it to Him, and He cannot take it
*from* you.

We are therefore embarking
on an organized, well-structured, and carefully planned program aimed
at learning how to offer to the Holy Spirit everything you do
*not* want. *He* knows what to do with it. You do
*not* know how to use what He knows. Whatever is revealed to Him
that is not of God is gone. Yet you must reveal it to *yourself*
in perfect willingness, for otherwise His knowledge remains useless
to you. Surely He will not fail to help you, since help is His
*only* purpose. Do you not have greater reason for fearing the
world as *you* perceive it than for looking at the cause of fear
and letting it go forever?
