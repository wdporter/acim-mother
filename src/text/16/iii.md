You still think holiness is difficult because you cannot see how it can be extended to include everyone. And you have learned that it *must* include everyone to *be* holy. Concern yourselves not with the extension of holiness, for the nature of miracles you do not understand. Nor do *you* do them. It is their extension, far beyond the limits you perceive, that demonstrates you did *not* do them. Why should you worry how the miracle extends to all the Family of God when you do not understand the miracle itself? One attribute is no more difficult to understand than is the whole. If miracles *are* at all, their attributes would *have* to be miraculous, being part of them.

There is a tendency to fragment and then to be concerned about the truth of just a little part of the whole. And this is but a way of avoiding or *looking away* from the whole to what you think you might be better able to understand. For this is but another way in which you would still try to keep understanding to *yourself*. A better and *far* more helpful way to think of miracles is this: You do not understand them, either in part *or* whole. Yet you have *done* them. Therefore, your understanding cannot be necessary. Yet it is still impossible to accomplish what you do not understand. And so there must be something in you that *does* understand.

To you the miracle *cannot* seem natural because what you have done to hurt your minds has made them so *unnatural* that they do not remember what is natural to them. And when you are *told* about it, you cannot understand it. The recognition of the part as whole and of the whole in every part is *perfectly* natural. For it is the way God thinks, and what is natural to Her *is* natural to you. Wholly natural perception would show you instantly that order of difficulty in miracles is quite impossible, for it involves a contradiction of what miracles mean. And if you could understand their meaning, their attributes could hardly cause you perplexity.

You *have* done miracles, but it is quite apparent that you have not done them alone. You have succeeded whenever you have reached another mind and *joined* with it. When two minds join as one and share one idea equally, the first link in the awareness of the Family of God as one has been made. When you have made this joining as the Holy Spirit bids you and have offered it to Him to use as He knows how, His natural perception of your gift enables *Him* to understand it and *you* to use His understanding on your behalf. It is impossible to convince you of the reality of what has clearly *been* accomplished through your willingness, as long as you believe that *you* must understand it or else it is not real.

You think your lack of understanding is a *loss* to you, and so you are unwilling to believe that what has happened is true. But can you *really* believe that all that has happened, even though you do *not* understand it, has *not* happened? Yet this *is* your position. You would have perfect faith in the Holy Spirit and in the effects of His teaching if you were not afraid to *acknowledge* what He taught you. For this acknowledgment means that what has happened you do not understand but that you are willing to accept it *because* it has happened.

How can faith in reality be yours while you are bent on making it unreal? And are you *really* safer in maintaining the unreality of what has happened than you would be in joyously accepting it for what it is and giving thanks for it? Honour the truth that has been given you, and be glad you do not understand it. Miracles are natural to God and to the One Who speaks for Her. For His [the Holy Spirit, the One who speaks for Her] task is to translate the miracle into the knowledge which it represents and which is lost to you. Let His understanding of the miracle be enough for you, and do not turn away from all the witnesses that He has given you to His reality.

No evidence will convince you of the truth of what you do not want. Yet your relationship with Him *is* real and *has* been demonstrated. Regard this not with fear but with rejoicing. The One you called upon *is* with you. Bid Him welcome and honour His witnesses, who bring you the glad tidings He has come. It is true, just as you fear, that to acknowledge Him *is* to deny all that you think you know. But it was *never* true. What gain is there to you in clinging to it and denying the evidence for truth? For you have come too near to truth to renounce it now, and you *will* yield to its compelling attraction. You can delay this now but only a little while. The host of God has called to you, and you *have* heard. Never again will you be wholly willing not to listen.

This is a year of joy in which your listening will increase, and peace will grow with its increase. The power of holiness and the *weakness* of attack have *both* been brought into awareness. And this has been accomplished in minds firmly convinced that holiness is weakness and attack is power. Should not this be a sufficient miracle to teach you that your Teacher is *not* of you? But remember also that whenever you have listened to His interpretation, the results have brought you joy. Would you prefer the results of *your* interpretation, considering honestly what they have been? God wills you better. Could you not look with greater charity on whom God loves with perfect love?

Do not interpret *against* God’s Love, for you have many witnesses which speak of it so clearly that only the blind and deaf could fail to see and hear them. This year, determine not to deny what has been given you by God [. Awake and *share* it], for that is the only reason She has called to you. Her Voice has spoken clearly, and yet you have so little faith in what you heard because you have preferred to place still greater faith in the disaster *you* have made. Today let us resolve *together* to accept the joyful tidings that disaster is not real and that reality is not disaster.

Reality is safe and sure and wholly kind to everyone and everything. There is no greater love than to accept this and be glad. For love asks only that you be *happy* and will give you everything that makes for happiness. You have never given any problem to the Holy Spirit He has not solved for you, nor will you ever do so. You have never tried to solve anything yourself and been successful. Is it not time you brought these facts *together* and made *sense* of them?

This is the year for the *application* of the ideas which have been given you. For the ideas are mighty forces to be used and not held idly by. They have already proved their power sufficiently for you to place your faith in them and not in their denial. This year invest in truth, and let it work in peace. Have faith in what has faith in *you*. Think what you have *really* seen and heard and *recognise* it. Can you be alone with witnesses like these?
