To empathize does not
mean to join in *suffering*, for that is what you must
*refuse* to understand. That is the *ego’s*
interpretation of empathy and is always used to form a special
relationship in which the suffering is shared. The capacity to
empathize is very useful to the Holy Spirit, provided you let Him use
it in His way. [His way is very different.] He does not understand
suffering and would have you teach it is not *understandable.*
When He relates through you, He does not relate through the ego to
another ego. He does not join in pain, knowing that healing pain is
not accomplished by delusional attempts to enter into it and lighten
it by sharing the delusion.

The clearest proof that
empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies in the fact that it is
applied only to certain types of problems and in certain people.
These it selects *out* and joins *with*. And it never joins
except to strengthen *itself.* [Having identified with what it
*thinks* it understands, it sees *itself* and would
*increase* itself by sharing what is *like* itself.] Make
no mistake about this maneuver; the ego always empathizes to
*weaken*, and to weaken is *always* to attack. You do not
know what empathizing means. Yet of this you may be sure — if you
will merely sit quietly by and let the Holy Spirit relate through
you, you will empathize with *strength* and *both* of you
will gain in strength, and not in weakness.

Your part is only to
remember this — you do not want anything *you* value to come
of the relationship. You will neither to hurt it nor to heal it in
your own way. You do not know what healing is. All you have learned
of empathy is from the *past.* And there is nothing from the
past that you would share, for there is nothing there that you would
*keep*. Do not use empathy to make the past real and so
perpetuate it. Step gently aside and let the healing be done
*for* you. Keep but one thought in mind and do not lose sight of
it, however tempted you may be to judge any situation and to
determine your response *by* judging it. Focus your mind only on
this:

*I am not alone, and I would not intrude\
the past upon my Guest.\
I have invited Him, and He is here.\
I need do nothing except **not to interfere**.* {.ml-.mr-12}
