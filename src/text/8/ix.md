We once said that the Holy
Spirit is the *Answer*. He is the Answer to everything because
He knows what the answer to everything *is*. The ego does not
know what a real question is, although it asks an endless number. Yet
*you* can learn this as you learn to question the value of the
ego and thus establish your ability to evaluate its questions. When
the ego tempts you to sickness, do not ask the Holy Spirit to heal
the *body*, for this would merely be to accept the ego’s belief
that the body is the proper aim for healing. Ask rather that
the Holy Spirit teach you the right *perception* of the body,
for perception alone can be distorted. *Only* perception can be sick because only perception can be *wrong*.

Wrong perception is
*distorted* willing, which wants things to be as they are not.
The *reality* of everything is totally harmless because total
harmlessness is the *condition* of its reality. It is also the
condition of your *awareness* of its reality. You do not have to
seek reality. It will seek *you* and find you when you meet its
conditions. Its conditions are part of what it *is*. And this
part only is up to you. The rest is of Itself. You need do so little
because it is so powerful that your little part will bring the whole
*to* you. Accept then your little part, and *let* the whole
be yours.

Wholeness heals because it
is of the mind. *All* forms of sickness, even unto death, are
physical expressions of the *fear of awakening*. They are
attempts to reinforce *unconsciousness* out of fear of
*consciousness*. This is a pathetic way of trying *not* to
know by rendering the faculties for knowing ineffectual. “Rest
in peace” is a blessing for the living, not the dead, because
rest comes from *waking*, not from sleeping. Sleep is
withdrawing; waking is joining. Dreams are *illusions* of
joining, taking on the ego’s distortions about what joining means
if you are sleeping under its guidance. Yet the Holy Spirit, too, has
use for sleep and can use dreams on behalf of *waking* if you
will let Him.

How you wake is the sign
of how you have used sleep. To whom did you give it? Under which
teacher did you place it? Whenever you wake dispiritedly, it was
*not* of the Holy Spirit. *Only* when you awaken joyously
have you utilized sleep according to the Holy Spirit’s purpose.
You can indeed be “drugged by sleep,” but this is always
because you have *misused* it on behalf of sickness. Sleep is no
more a form of death than death is a form of unconsciousness.
*Unconsciousness is impossible*. You can rest in peace only
*because* you are awake.

Healing is release from
the fear of waking and the substitution of the *will to wake*.
The will to wake is the will to love, since *all* healing involves
replacing fear with love. The Holy Spirit cannot distinguish among
degrees of error, for if He taught that one form of sickness is more
serious than another, He would be teaching that one error can be *more
real* than another. His function is to distinguish *only*
between the false and the true, *replacing* the false with the
true.

The ego, which always
*weakens* the will, wants to *separate* the body from the
mind. This is an attempt to *destroy* it, yet the ego actually
believes that it is *protecting* it. This is because the ego
believes that *mind is dangerous* and that to *make
mindless* is to heal. But to make mindless is impossible, since it
would mean to make nothing out of what God created. The ego  *despises*
weakness, even though it makes every effort to *induce* it. The
ego *wants* only what it hates. To the ego this is perfectly
sensible. Believing in the power of attack, the ego *wants*
attack.

You have surely begun to
realize that this is a very practical course which means
*exactly* what it says. So does the Bible, if it is properly
understood. There has been a marked tendency on the part of many of
the Bible’s followers and also its translators to be entirely
literal about fear and *its* effects but *not* about love
and *its* results. Thus, “hellfire” means
“burning,” but raising the dead becomes allegorical.
Actually, it is *particularly* the references to the outcomes of
love which *should* be taken literally because the Bible is
*about* love, being about God.

The Bible enjoins you to
be perfect, to heal *all* errors, to take no thought of the body
*as separate,* and to accomplish all things in my name. This is
not my name alone, for ours is a shared identification. The name of
God’s Son is one, and you are enjoined to do the works of love
because we *share* this oneness. Our minds are whole
*because* they are one. If you are sick you are withdrawing from
me. Yet you cannot withdraw from me alone. You can only withdraw from
yourself *and* me.

I would not ask you to do
the things you cannot do, and it is impossible that I could do things
you cannot do. Given this, and given this *quite literally,*
there can be nothing which prevents you from doing *exactly*
what I ask, and everything which argues *for* your doing it. I
give you no limits because God lays none upon you. When you limit
*yourself*, we are *not* of one mind and that *is*
sickness. Yet sickness is not of the body, but of the *mind*.
*All* forms of dysfunction are merely signs that the mind has split and
does not accept a unified purpose.

The unification of
*purpose*, then, is the Holy Spirit’s *only* way of
healing. This is because it is the only level at which healing means
anything. The re-establishing of meaning in a chaotic thought system
*is* the only way to heal it. We have said that your task is
only to meet the conditions *for* meaning since meaning itself
is of God. Yet your *return* to meaning is essential to
*Hers* because your meaning is *part* of Hers. Your healing,
then, is part of *Her* health since it is part of Her Wholeness.
She cannot *lose* this, but *you* can not *know* it.
Yet it is still Her Will for you, and Her Will *must* stand
forever and in all things.
