The body cannot heal
because it cannot make itself sick. It *needs* no healing. Its
health or sickness depends entirely on how the mind perceives it and
the purpose which the mind would use it *for*. And it is obvious
that a segment of the mind *can* see itself as separated from the
Universal Purpose. When this occurs, the body becomes its weapon used
*against* this Purpose to demonstrate the “fact” that
separation has occurred. The body thus becomes the instrument of
illusion, acting accordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what
truth has never said, and behaving insanely, being imprisoned
*by* insanity.

Do not overlook our earlier
statement that faithlessness leads straight to illusions. For
faithlessness is the perception of a companion as a body, and the body
cannot be used for purposes of union. If, then, you see your companion
*as* a body, you have established a condition in which uniting with them
becomes impossible. Your faithlessness to them has separated you from
them and kept you *both* apart from being healed. Your
faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit’s purpose and
brought illusions centred on the *body* to stand between you. And the
body *will* seem to be sick, for you have made of it an
“enemy” of healing and the opposite of truth.

It cannot be difficult to
realise that faith must be the opposite of faithlessness. Yet the
difference in how they operate is less apparent, though it follows
directly from the fundamental difference in what they are.
Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all
limitations and make whole. [Faithlessness would destroy and
*separate*; faith would unite and *heal*.] Faithlessness
would interpose illusions between the Child of God and their Creator;
faith would remove all obstacles that seem to rise between them.
Faithlessness is wholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to
truth. Partial dedication is impossible. Truth is the *absence* of
illusion; illusion the *absence* of truth.

Both cannot *be*
together nor perceived in the same place. To dedicate yourself to
both is to set up a goal forever impossible to attain, for part of it
is sought through the body, thought of as a means for seeking out
reality through attack, while the other part would heal and therefore
calls upon the mind and not the body. The inevitable compromise is
the belief that the body must be healed, and not the mind. For this
divided goal has given both an equal reality, which could be possible
only if the mind is limited to the body and divided into little parts
of seeming wholeness but without connection. This will not harm the
body, but it *will* keep the delusional thought system in the
*mind*.

Here then is healing needed. And it is here that healing *is*. For God gave 
healing not apart from sickness, nor established remedy where sickness cannot
be. They are together, and when they are seen together, all attempts
to keep both truth and illusion in the mind, where both must be, are
recognised as dedication to illusion and given up when brought to
truth and seen as totally irreconcilable with truth in any respect or
in any way.

Truth and illusion have *no* connection. This will remain forever true, however 
much you seek to connect them. But illusions are always connected, as is
truth. Each is united, a complete thought system, but totally
disconnected to each other. Where there is no overlap, there
separation must be complete. And to perceive this is to recognise
where separation is and where it must be healed. The result of an
idea is never separate from its source. The *idea* of separation
produced the body and remains connected to it, making it sick because
of its identification with it. You think you are protecting the body
by hiding this connection, for this concealment seems to keep your
identification safe from the “attack” of truth.

If you but understood how
much this strange concealment has hurt your mind and how confused
your own identification has become because of it! You do not see how
great the devastation wrought by your faithlessness. For
faithlessness is an attack which seems to be justified by its
*results*. For by withholding faith, you see what *is* unworthy of it and
cannot look beyond the barrier to what is joined with you.

To have faith is to heal.
It is the sign that you have accepted the Atonement for yourself and
would therefore share it. By faith you offer the gift of freedom from
the past, which *you* received. You do not use anything your companions
have done before to condemn them *now*. You freely choose to
overlook their errors, looking past all barriers between your self and
theirs and seeing them as one. And in that one you see your faith is
fully justified. There *is* no justification for faithlessness,
but faith is *always* justified.

Faith is the opposite of
fear, as much a part of love as fear is of attack. Faith is the
acknowledgment of union. It is the gracious acknowledgment of
everyone as a Child of your most loving Mother, loved by Her like you
and therefore loved by you as yourself. It is Her Love that joins
you, and for Her Love you would keep no one separate from *yours*. Each
one appears just as they are perceived in the holy instant, united in
your purpose to be released from guilt. You saw the Christ in them,
and they were healed because you looked on what makes faith forever
justified in everyone.

Faith is the gift of God,
through Him [the Holy Spirit] Whom God has given you. Faithlessness looks upon the Child
of God and judges them unworthy of forgiveness. But through the eyes
of faith, the Child of God is seen *already* forgiven, free of all the
guilt they laid upon themself. Faith sees them only *now* because it
looks not to the past to judge them, but would see in them only what it
would see in *you*. It sees not through the body’s eyes nor looks
to bodies for its justification. It is the messenger of the new
perception sent forth to gather witnesses unto its coming and to
return their messages to you. Faith is as easily exchanged for
knowledge as is the real world. For faith arises from the Holy
Spirit’s perception and is the sign you share it with Him. Faith
is a gift you offer to the Child of God through Him, and wholly
acceptable to their Mother as to them. And therefore offered *you*.

Your holy relationship, with its new purpose, offers you faith to give unto each other. Your faithlessness had driven you apart, and so you did not recognise
salvation in each other. Yet faith *unites* you in the holiness you
see, not through the body’s eyes but in the sight of Him Who
joined you and in Whom *you* are united. Grace is not given to a body,
but to a *mind*. And the mind that receives it looks instantly
beyond the body and sees the holy place where it was healed. *There* is
the altar where the grace was given, in which it stands. Do you,
then, offer grace and blessing to each other, for you stand at the
same altar where grace was laid for *both* of you. And be you healed by
grace together, that *you* may heal through faith.

In the holy instant, you
stand before the altar God has raised unto Himself and *both* of you.
Lay faithlessness aside and come to it together. There will you see
the miracle of your relationship as it was made again through faith.
And there it is that you will realise that there is nothing faith
cannot forgive. No error interferes with its calm sight, which brings
the miracle of healing with equal ease to *all* of them. For what the
messengers of love are sent to do *they do*, returning the glad
tidings that it was done to you who stand together before the altar
from which they were sent forth.

As faithlessness will keep
your little kingdoms barren and separate, so will faith help the Holy
Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy garden which He would
make of it. For faith brings peace, and so it calls on truth to enter
and make lovely what has already been prepared for loveliness. Truth
follows faith and peace, completing the process of making lovely
which they begin. For faith is still a learning goal, no longer
needed when the lesson has been learned. Yet truth will stay
forever.

Let then your dedication
be to the eternal and learn how *not* to interfere with it and make it
slave to time. For what you think you do to the eternal you do to
*you*. Whom God created as His Son is slave to nothing, being
lord of all along with his Creator. You can enslave a body, but an
*idea* is free, incapable of being kept in prison or limited in
any way except by the mind that thought it. For it remains joined to
its source, which is its jailor or its liberator, according to which
it chooses as its purpose for itself.
