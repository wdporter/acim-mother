Love is extension. To
withhold the smallest gift is not to know love’s purpose. Love
offers everything forever. Hold back but one belief, one offering,
and love is gone because you asked a substitute to take its place.
And now must war, the substitute for peace, come with the one
alternative that you can choose for love. Your choosing it has given
it all the reality it seems to have.

Beliefs will never openly attack each other, because conflicting outcomes are 
impossible. But an unrecognised belief is a decision to war in secret, where the 
results of conflict are kept unknown and never brought to reason to be 
considered sensible or not. And many senseless outcomes have been reached, 
and meaningless decisions have been made and kept hidden to become beliefs, 
now given power to direct all subsequent decisions. Mistake you not the power 
of these hidden warriors to disrupt your peace. For it *is* at their mercy while 
you decide to leave it there. The secret enemies of peace, your least decision to 
choose attack instead of love, unrecognised and swift to challenge you to 
combat and to violence far more inclusive than you think, are there 
by your election. Do not deny their presence nor their terrible 
results. All that can be denied is their *reality,* but not their outcome.

All that is ever cherished as a hidden belief, to be defended though 
unrecognised, is faith in specialness. This takes many forms but always clashes 
with the reality of God’s creation and with the grandeur which She gave Her 
Child. What else could justify attack? For who could hate someone whose 
Self is theirs and whom She knows? Only the special could have enemies, 
for they are different and not the same. And difference of any kind 
imposes orders of reality and a need to judge that cannot be escaped.

What God created cannot be
attacked, for there is nothing in the universe unlike itself. But
what is different *calls* for judgment, and this must come from
someone “better”, someone incapable of being like what they
condemn, “above” it, sinless by comparison with it. And
thus does specialness become a means and end at once. For specialness
not only sets apart but serves as grounds from which attack on those
who seem “beneath” the special one is “natural”
and “just”. The special ones feel weak and frail
*because* of differences, for what would make them special
*is* their enemy. Yet they protect its enmity and call it
“friend”. On its behalf they fight against the universe,
for nothing in the world they value more.

Specialness is the great
dictator of the wrong decisions. Here is the grand illusion of what
you are and what your companion is. And here is what must make the body
dear and worth preserving. Specialness must be *defended*.
Illusions *can* attack it, and they *do*. For what your
companion must become to *keep* your specialness *is* an
illusion. They who are “worse” than you must be attacked so
that your specialness can live on their defeat. For specialness is
triumph, and its victory is their defeat and shame. How can they live
with all your sins upon them? And who must be their conqueror but
you?

Would it be possible for
you to hate your companions if you were like them? Could you attack them
if you realised you journey with them to a goal that is the same?
Would you not help them reach it in every way you could if their
attainment of it were perceived as yours? You *are* their enemy in
specialness; their friend in a shared purpose. Specialness can never
share, for it depends on goals that you alone can reach. And they must
never reach them, or your goal is jeopardized. Can love have meaning
where the goal is triumph? And what decision can be made for this
that will not hurt you? Your companion is your friend *because*
their Mother created them like you. There *is* no difference. You
have been given to each other that love might be extended, not cut
off from one another. What you *keep* is lost to you. God gave
you both Herself, and to remember this is now the only purpose that
you share. And so it is the only one you *have*.

Could you attack each other
if you chose to see no specialness of any kind between you? Look
fairly at whatever makes you give each other only partial welcome or
would let you think that you are better off apart. Is it not always
your belief your specialness is *limited* by your relationship?
And is not this the “enemy” that makes you both illusions
to each other?

The fear of God and of each other comes from each unrecognised belief in 
specialness. For each demands the other bow to it *against* their will. And God 
Herself must honour it or suffer vengeance. Every twinge of malice or 
stab of hate or wish to separate arises here. For here the purpose 
which you share becomes obscured from both of you. You would oppose 
this course because it teaches you you are *alike*. You have no 
purpose that is not the same and none your Mother does not share with 
you. For your relationship has been made clean of special goals. And 
would you now *defeat* the goal of holiness that Heaven gave it? 
What perspective can the special have that does not change with every 
seeming blow, each slight, or fancied judgment on itself?

Those who are special
*must* defend illusions against the truth. For what is
specialness but an attack upon the Will of God? You love your companions
not while it is this you would defend against them. This is what
*they* attack and *you* protect. Here is the ground of
battle which you wage against them. Here must they be your enemy and not
your friends. Never can there be peace among the different. They are your
friends *because* you are the same.
