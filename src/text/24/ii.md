Comparison must be an ego device, for love makes none. Specialness always makes comparisons. It is established by a lack seen in another, and maintained by searching for, and keeping clear in sight, all lacks it can perceive. This does it seek, and this it looks upon. And always whom it thus diminishes would be your saviors, had you not chosen to make of them a tiny measure of your specialness instead. Against the littleness you see in them you stand as tall and stately, clean and honest, pure and unsullied, by comparison with what you see. Nor do you understand it is yourself that you diminish thus.

Pursuit of specialness is always at the cost of peace. Who can attack their savior and cut them down, yet recognize their strong support? Who can detract from their omnipotence, yet share their power? And who can use them as the gauge of littleness, and be released from limits? You have a function in salvation. Its pursuit will bring you joy. But the pursuit of specialness must bring you pain. Here is a goal that would defeat salvation, and thus run counter to the Will of God. To value specialness is to esteem an alien will to which illusions of yourself are dearer than the truth.

Specialness is the idea of sin made real. Sin is impossible even to imagine without this base. For sin arose from it, out of nothingness; an evil flower with no roots at all. Here is the self-made “savior,” the “creator” who creates unlike the Mother, and which made Her Son like to itself and not like unto Her. Her “special” sons are many, never one, each one in exile from themselves, and Her of Whom they are a part. Nor do they love the Oneness which created them as one with Her. They chose their specialness instead of Heaven and instead of peace, and wrapped it carefully in sin, to keep it “safe” from truth.

You are not special. If you think you are, and would defend your specialness against the truth of what you really are, how can you know the truth? What answer that the Holy Spirit gives can reach you, when it is your specialness to which you listen, and which asks and answers? Its tiny answer, soundless in the melody that pours from God to you eternally in loving praise of what you are, is all you listen to. And that vast song of honor and of love for what you are seems silent and unheard before its “mightiness.” You strain your ears to hear its soundless voice, and yet the Call of God Herself is soundless to you.

You can defend your specialness, but never will you hear the Voice for God beside it. They speak a different language and they fall on different ears. To every special one a different message, and one with different meaning, is the truth. Yet how can truth be different to each one? The special messages the special hear convince them they are different and apart; each in their special sins and “safe” from love, which does not see their specialness at all. Christ’s vision is their “enemy,” for it sees not what they would look upon, and it would show them that the specialness they think they see is an illusion.

What would they see instead? The shining radiance of the Son of God, so like his Mother that the memory of Her springs instantly to mind. And with this memory, the Son remembers his own creations, as like to him as he is to his Mother. And all the world he made, and all his specialness, and all the sins he held in its defense against himself, will vanish as his mind accepts the truth about himself, as it returns to take their place. This is the only “cost” of truth: You will no longer see what never was, nor hear what makes no sound. Is it a sacrifice to give up nothing, and to receive the Love of God forever?

You who have chained your saviors to your specialness, and given it their place, remember this: They have not lost the power to forgive you all the sins you think you placed between them and the function of salvation given them for you. Nor will you change their function, any more than you can change the truth in them and in yourself. But be you certain that the truth is just the same in both. It gives no different messages, and has one meaning. And it is one you and your companion both can understand, and one that brings release to both of you. Here stand your companions with the key to Heaven in their hands, held out to you. Let not the dream of specialness remain between you. What is one is joined in truth.

Think of the loveliness that you will see within yourself, when you have looked on them as on a friend. They _are_ the enemies of specialness, but only friend to what is real in you. Not one attack you thought you made on them has taken from them the gift that God would have them give to you. Their need to give it is as great as yours to have it. Let them forgive you all your specialness, and make you whole in mind and one with them. They wait for your forgiveness only that they may return it unto you. It is not God Who has condemned Her Son, but you, to save their specialness and kill their Selves.

You have come far along the way of truth; too far to falter now. Just one step more, and every vestige of the fear of God will melt away in love. Your companion’s specialness and yours _are_ enemies, and bound in hate to kill each other and deny they are the same. Yet it is not illusions that have reached this final obstacle which seems to make God and Her Heaven so remote that They cannot be reached. Here in this holy place does truth stand waiting to receive you and your companion in silent blessing, and in peace so real and so encompassing that nothing stands outside. Leave all illusions of yourself outside this place, to which you come in hope and honesty.

Here are your saviors _from_ your specialness. They are in need of your acceptance of themselves as part of you, as you for them. You are alike to God as God is to Herself. She is not special, for She would not keep one part of what She is unto Herself, not given to Her Son but kept for Her alone. And it is this you fear, for if She is not special, then She willed Her Son to be like Her, and your companions _are_ like you. Not special, but possessed of everything, including you. Give them but what they have, remembering God gave Herself to you and your companion in equal love, that both might share the universe with Her Who chose that love could never be divided, and kept separate from what it is and must forever be.

You _are_ your companions’; part of love was not denied to them. But can it be that you have lost because they are complete? What has been given them makes you complete, as it does them. God’s Love gave you to them and them to you because She gave Herself. What is the same as God is one with Her. And only specialness could make the truth of God and you as one seem anything but Heaven, with the hope of peace at last in sight.

Specialness is the seal of treachery upon the gift of love. Whatever serves its purpose must be given to kill. No gift that bears its seal but offers treachery to giver and receiver. Not one glance from eyes it veils but looks on sight of death. Not one believer in its potency but seeks for bargains and for compromise that would establish sin love’s substitute, and serve it faithfully. And no relationship that holds its purpose dear but clings to murder as safety’s weapon, and the great defender of all illusions from the “threat” of love.

The hope of specialness makes it seem possible God made the body as the prison house that keeps Her Son from Her. For it demands a special place God cannot enter, and a hiding place where none is welcome but your tiny self. Nothing is sacred here but unto you, and you alone, apart and separate from all your companions; safe from all intrusions of sanity upon illusions; safe from God and safe for conflict everlasting. Here are the gates of hell you closed upon yourself, to rule in madness and in loneliness your special realm, apart from God, away from truth and from salvation.

The key you threw away God gave your companion, whose holy hands would offer it to you when you were ready to accept Her plan for your salvation in the place of yours. How could this readiness be reached save through the sight of all your misery, and the awareness that your plan has failed, and will forever fail to bring you peace and joy of any kind? Through this despair you travel now, yet it is but illusion of despair. The death of specialness is not your death, but your awaking into life eternal. You but emerge from an illusion of what you are to the acceptance of yourself as God created you.
