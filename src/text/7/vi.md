The body is nothing more
than a framework for developing abilities. It is therefore a means
for developing *potentials*, which is quite apart from what the
potential is used *for*. *That* is a *decision*. The
effects of the ego’s decision in this matter are so apparent that
they need no elaboration here, but the Holy Spirit’s decision to
use the body *only* for communication has such a direct
connection with healing that it *does* need clarification. Unhealed healers *obviously* does not understand their own
vocation.

*Only* minds
communicate. Since the ego *cannot* obliterate the impulse to communicate because it is also the impulse to create, the ego can only teach you that the *body* can both communicate *and*
create and therefore does not *need* the mind. The ego thus
tries to teach you that the body can *act* like the mind and is
therefore self-sufficient. Yet we have learned that behaviour is
*not* the level for either teaching *or* learning. This
must be so, since you *can* act in accordance with what you do
*not* believe. To do this, however, will weaken you as teachers
*and* learners because, as has been repeatedly emphasized, you
teach what you *do* believe. An inconsistent lesson will be
poorly taught *and poorly learned*. If you teach both sickness
*and* healing, you are both a poor teacher *and* a poor
learner.

Healing is the one ability which everyone can develop and *must* develop if 
they are to be healed. Healing is the Holy Spirit’s form of communication and 
the *only* one He knows. He recognises no other, because He does 
not accept the ego’s confusion of mind and body. Minds can 
communicate, but they *cannot* hurt. The body in the service of 
the ego can hurt other *bodies*, but this cannot occur unless 
the body has *already* been confused with the mind. This fact, 
too, can be used either for healing or for magic, but you must 
remember that magic is *always* the belief that healing is 
*harmful*. This is its totally insane premise, and so it proceeds accordingly.

Healing only
*strengthens*. Magic *always* tries to weaken. Healing
perceives *nothing* in the healer that everyone else does not
*share* with them. Magic *always* sees something
“special” in the healer which they believe they can offer as a
gift to someone who does *not* have it. They may believe that the
gift comes *from* God *to* them, but it is quite evident that they
does not understand God if they think they have something that others *do not*. You might well ask, then, why some healing *can*
result from this kind of thinking, and there is a reason for this.


However misguided “magical healers” may be, they are *also* trying to help. They are conflicted and unstable, but *at times* they are offering something to the Family of God, and the only thing the Family of God can *accept* is healing. When the so-called “healing” works, then, the impulse to help and to *be* helped have coincided. This is coincidental because healers may *not* be experiencing themselves as truly helpful at the time, but the belief that they *are*, in the mind of another, helps *them*.

The Holy Spirit does
*not* work by chance, and healing that is of Him *always*
works. Unless the healer *always* heals by Him, the results
*will* vary. Yet healing itself *is* consistence since
*only* consistence is conflict-free, and only the conflict-free
*are* whole. By accepting exceptions and acknowledging that they
can sometimes heal and sometimes not, healers are *obviously*
accepting inconsistency. They are therefore *in* conflict and
*teaching* conflict. Can anything of God *not* be for all
and for always?

Love is incapable of
*any* exceptions. Only if there is fear does the *idea* of
exceptions seem to be meaningful. Exceptions are fearful because they
are made *by* fear. The “fearful healer” is a
contradiction in terms and is therefore a concept which *only* a
conflicted mind could possibly perceive as meaningful. Fear does
*not* gladden. Healing *does*. Fear *always* makes
exceptions. Healing *never* does. Fear produces dissociation
because it induces *separation*. Healing *always* produces
harmony because it proceeds from integration.

Healing is predictable
because it can be counted on. *Everything* that is of God can be
counted on because everything of God is wholly *real*. Healing
can be counted on *because* it is inspired by Her Voice and is
in accord with Her laws. Yet if healing *is* consistence, it
cannot be inconsistently understood. Understanding *means*
consistence because *God* means consistence. Since that is *Her*
meaning, it is also *yours*. Your meaning cannot *be* out
of accord with Hers because your whole meaning, and your *only*
meaning, comes *from* Her and is *like* Her. God cannot be
out of accord with *Herself*, and *you* cannot be out of
accord with Her. You cannot separate your *self* from your
Creator, Who created you by sharing *Her* Being *with*
you.

Unhealed healers want gratitude *from* their companions, but they is not 
grateful *to* them. This is because they [unhealed healers] think they are 
*giving* something *to* them [companions] and are *not* receiving something 
equally desirable in return. Their [unhealed healers’] *teaching* is limited 
because they are *learning* so little. Their healing lesson is limited by their own 
ingratitude, which is a lesson in *sickness*. Learning is 
constant and so vital in its power for change that a Child of God can 
recognise their power in one instant and change the world in the next. 
That is because by changing *their* mind they have changed the most 
powerful device that was ever created *for* change.

This in no way contradicts the changelessness of mind as *God* created it, but 
you think that you *have* changed it as long as you learn through the ego. 
This *does* place you in a position of needing to learn a lesson 
which seems contradictory — you must learn to change your mind 
*about* your mind. Only by this can you learn that it *is* 
changeless. When you heal that is exactly what you *are* 
learning. You are recognising the changeless mind in your companions by 
realising that they *could* not have changed their mind. That is how 
you perceive the Holy Spirit in them. It is *only* the Holy 
Spirit in them that never changes His mind. They themselves must think they 
*can*, or they would not perceive themselves as sick. They therefore 
does not know what their self *is*.

If *you* see only the
changeless in them, you have not really changed them at all. By
changing *your* mind about theirs *for* them, you help them
*undo* the change their ego thinks it has made in them. As you can
hear two voices, so you can see in two ways. One way shows you an
image, or better, an idol which you may worship out of fear but which
you will never love. The other shows you only truth, which you will
love because you will *understand* it. Understanding is
*appreciation* because what you understand you can
*identify* with, and by making it part of *you*, you have
accepted it with love.

That is how God Herself
created *you* — in understanding, in appreciation, and in love.
The ego is totally unable to understand this, because it does
*not* understand what it makes; it does *not* appreciate
it; and it does *not* love it. It incorporates to *take
away.* It literally believes that every time it deprives someone
of something, *it* has increased. We have spoken often of the
increase of the Realm by *your* creations, which can only be
created as *you* were. The whole glory and perfect joy that
*is* the Realm lies in you to give. Do you not *want* to
give it? 

You *cannot* forget
the Mother because I am with you, and *I* cannot forget Her. To
forget *me* is to forget yourself and Her Who created you. Our
companions *are* forgetful. That is why they need your remembrance of me and Her Who created me. Through this remembrance, you can change their minds about *themselves*, as I can change
*yours.* Your minds are so powerful a light that you can look
into theirs and enlighten them, as I can enlighten yours. I do not
want to share my *body* in communion, because that is to share
nothing. [Would I try to share an illusion with the most holy
children of a most holy Mother?] Yet I do want to share my
*mind* with you because we *are* of One Mind and that
Mind *is* ours.

See *only* this
Mind everywhere because only this *is* everywhere and in
everything. It *is* everything because it encompasses all things
within *itself*. Blessed are you who perceive only this, because
you perceive only what is true. Come therefore unto me and learn of
the truth in *you*. The Mind we share is shared by all our
companions, and as we see them truly, they *will* be healed. Let
*your* mind shine with mine upon their minds and by our gratitude to them, make them aware of the light in *them*.

This light will shine back upon *you* and on the whole Family of God because this is your proper gift to God. She will accept it and give it to the Family of God because it is acceptable to Her and therefore to Her Children. This is the true communion of the Spirit, Who sees the altar of God in everyone and, by bringing it to *your* appreciation, calls upon you to love God *and* Her creations. You can appreciate the Family of God *only* as one. This is part of the Law of Creation and therefore governs *all* thought.
