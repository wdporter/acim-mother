Whenever you deny a blessing to a companion, *you* will feel deprived. This is because denial is as total as love. It is as impossible to deny part of the Family of God as it is to love it in part. Nor is it possible to love it totally *at times*. You cannot be *totally* committed *sometimes*. Remember a very early lesson — “Never underestimate the power of denial”. It has no power in itself, but you can give it the power of *your* mind, whose power is without limit of any kind. If you use it to deny reality, reality *is* gone for you. *Reality cannot be partly appreciated*. That is why denying any part of it means you have lost awareness of *all* of it.

That is the negative side of the law as it operates in this world. Yet denial is a defence, and so it is as capable of being used positively as it is of being used destructively. Used negatively it *will* be destructive because it will be used for attack, but in the service of the Holy Spirit, [the law becomes as beneficent as all of the laws of God. Stated positively,] the law requires you to recognise only *part* of reality to appreciate *all* of it. Mind is too powerful to be subject to exclusion. You will *never* be able to exclude yourself from what you project.

When a companion acts insanely, they are offering you an opportunity to bless them. Their need is *yours*. You *need* the blessing you can offer them. There is no way for you to have it *except* by giving it. This is the law of God, and it has *no* exceptions. What you deny you *lack*, not because it *is* lacking, but because you have denied it in another and are therefore not aware of it in *you*. Every response you make is determined by what you *think* you are, and what you *want* to be *is* what you think you are. Therefore, what you want to be determines every response you make.

You do not need God’s blessing since that you have forever, but you *do* need *yours.* The picture you see of yourselves is deprived, unloving and very vulnerable. You *cannot* love this. Yet you can very easily escape from it or, better, leave it behind. You are not *there*, and that is not *you*. Do not see this picture in anyone, or you have accepted it *as* you. *All* illusions about the Family of God are dispelled together, as they were *made* together. Teach no one that they are what *you* would *not* want to be. Your companion is the mirror in which you will see the image of yourself as long as perception lasts. And perception *will* last until the Family of God knows itself as whole.

You made perception, and it must last as long as you *want* it. Illusions are investments. They will last as long as you value them. Values are relative, but they are powerful because they are mental judgements. The only way to dispel illusions is to withdraw *all* investment from them, and they will have no life for you because you have put them *out of your mind*. While you include them *in* it, you are *giving* life to them, except there is nothing there to receive your gift.

The gift of life *is* yours to give because it was given *you.* You are unaware of your gift *because* you do not give it. You cannot make nothing live since it cannot *be* enlivened. Therefore, you are not extending the gift you both have and are, and so you do not know your being. *All* confusion comes from not extending life, since that is *not* the Will of your Creator. You can do nothing apart from Her, and you *do* do nothing apart from Her. Keep Her way to remember yourselves and teach Her way, lest you forget yourselves. Give only honour to the Children of the living God and count yourselves among them gladly.

*Only* honour is a fitting gift for those whom God Herself created worthy of honour and whom She honours. Give them the appreciation which God accords them always because they are Her beloved Children in whom She is well pleased. You cannot *be* apart from them because you are not apart from Her. Rest in Her Love and protect your rest by loving. But love *everything* She created of which you are a part, or you cannot learn of Her peace and accept Her gift for *yourself* and *as* yourself. You cannot know your own perfection until you have honoured all those who were created *like* you.

One Child of God is the *only* teacher sufficiently worthy to teach another. One Teacher is in all your minds, and He [the Holy Spirit] teaches the same lesson to all. He always teaches you the inestimable worth of *every* Child of God, teaching it with infinite patience born of the [love of Her for Whom] He speaks. Every attack is a call for His patience,  since *only* His patience can translate attack into blessing. Those who attack do not *know* they are blessed. They attack because they believe they are *deprived*. Give therefore of *your* abundance and teach your companions *theirs*. Do not share their delusions of scarcity, or you will perceive *yourself* as lacking.

Attack could never promote attack unless you perceived it as a means of depriving you of something you *want*. Yet you cannot *lose* anything unless *you* did not value it and therefore did not *want* it. This makes you feel *deprived* of it, and by projecting your own rejection, you believe that others are taking it *from* you. One *must* be fearful if they believe that their companion is attacking them to tear the Realm of Heaven from them. This is the ultimate basis for *all* of the ego’s projection.

Being the part of your mind which does not believe it is responsible for *itself* and being without allegiance to God, the ego is incapable of trust. Projecting its insane belief that *you* have been treacherous to *your* Creator, it believes that your companions, who are as incapable of this as *you* are, are out to take God *from* you. Whenever a companion attacks another, this *is* what they believe. Projection *always* sees your will in others. If you will to separate yourself from God, that *is* what you will think others are doing *to* you.

You *are* the Will of God. Do not accept anything else *as* your will, or you are denying what you are. Deny this and you *will* attack, believing you have *been* attacked. But see the Love of God in you, and you will see it everywhere because it *is* everywhere. See Her abundance in everyone, and you will know that you are in Her *with* them. They are part of you, as you are part of God. *You* are as lonely without understanding this as God Herself is lonely when Her Children do not know Her. The peace of God *is* understanding this. There is only one way *out* of the world’s thinking, just as there was only one way *into* it. Understand totally by understanding *totality*.

Perceive *any* part of the ego’s thought system as wholly insane, wholly delusional, and wholly undesirable, and you have correctly evaluated *all* of it. This correction enables you to perceive *any* part of creation as wholly real, wholly perfect, and *wholly desirable.* Wanting this *only*, you will *have* this only, and giving this only you will *be* only this. The gifts you offer to the ego are *always* experienced as sacrifices, but the gifts you offer to the Realm are gifts to *you.* They will always be treasured by God because they belong to Her beloved Children who belong to Her. All power and glory are yours *because* the Realm is Hers.
