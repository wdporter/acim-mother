Pain demonstrates the body
must be real. It is a loud, obscuring voice whose shrieks would
silence what the Holy Spirit says and keep His words from your
awareness. Pain compels attention, drawing it away from Him and
focusing upon itself. Its purpose is the same as pleasure, for they
both are means to make the body real. What shares a common purpose is
the same. This is the law of purpose, which unites all those who
share in it within itself. Pleasure and pain are equally unreal,
because their purpose cannot *be* achieved. Thus are they means
for nothing, for they have a goal without a meaning. And they share
the lack of meaning which their purpose has.

Sin shifts from pain to
pleasure and again to pain. For either witness is the same and
carries but one message: “You are here within this body, and you
can be hurt. You can have pleasure, too, but only at the cost of
pain”. These witnesses are joined by many more. Each one seems
different because it has a different name, and so it seems to answer
to a different sound. Except for this, the witnesses of sin are all
alike. Call pleasure pain, and it will hurt. Call pain a pleasure,
and the pain behind the pleasure will be felt no more. Sin’s
witnesses but shift from name to name, as one steps forward and
another back. Yet which is foremost makes no difference. Sin’s
witnesses hear but the call of death.

This body, purposeless
within itself, holds all your memories and all your hopes. You use
its eyes to see, its ears to hear, and let it tell you what it is it
feels. *It does not know.* It tells you but the names you gave to it to use when *you* call forth the witnesses to its reality.
You cannot choose among them which are real, for any one you choose
is like the rest. This name or that, but nothing more, you choose.
You do not make a witness true because you called them by truth’s
name. The truth is found in them if it is truth they *represent*.
And otherwise they lie, if you should call them by the holy Name of God
Herself.

God’s Witness sees no
witnesses *against* the body. Neither does He [God’s Witness, that is, the 
Holy Spirit] harken to the witnesses by other names which speak in other 
ways for its reality. He *knows* it is not real. For nothing could contain what you believe it holds within. Nor could it tell a part of God Herself what
it should feel and what its function is. Yet must He love whatever
you hold dear. And for each witness to the body’s death He sends
a witness to your life in Her Who knows no death. Each miracle He
brings is witness that the body is not real. Its pains and pleasures
does He heal alike, for *all* sin’s witnesses do His
replace.

The miracle makes no
distinctions in the names by which sin’s witnesses are called. It
merely proves that what they represent has no effects. And this it
proves because its own effects have come to take their place. It
matters not the name by which you called your suffering. It is no
longer there. The One Who brings the miracle perceived them all as
one and called by name of fear. As fear is witness unto death, so is
the miracle the witness unto life. It is a witness no one can deny,
for it is the *effects* of life it brings. The dying live, the
dead arise, and pain has vanished. Yet a miracle speaks not but for
itself, but what it represents.

Love, too, has symbols in
a world of sin. The miracle forgives because it stands for what is
past forgiveness and is true. How foolish and insane it is to think a
miracle is bound by laws which it came solely to undo! The laws of
sin have different witnesses with different strengths. And they
attest to different sufferings. Yet to the One Who sends forth
miracles to bless the world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly
pleasure, and the throes of death itself are but a single sound — a
call for healing and a plaintive cry for help within a world of
misery. It is their *sameness* that the miracle attests. It is
their sameness that it *proves*.

The laws which call them
different are dissolved and *shown* as powerless. The purpose of
a miracle is to accomplish this. And God Herself has guaranteed the
strength of miracles for what they witness to. Be witnesses unto the
miracle and not the laws of sin. There is no need to suffer any more.
But there *is* need that you be healed, because the suffering of the world has made it deaf to its salvation and deliverance.

The resurrection of the world awaits your healing and your happiness, that you may demonstrate the healing of the world. The holy instant will replace all sin if you but carry its effects with you. And no one will elect to suffer more. What better function could you serve than this? Be healed that you may heal, and suffer not the laws of sin to be applied to you. And truth will be revealed to you who chose to let love’s symbols take the place of sin.
