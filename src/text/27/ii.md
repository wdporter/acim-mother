Whenever you consent to
suffer pain, to be deprived, unfairly treated or in need of
anything, you but accuse your companions of attack upon God’s Child.
You hold a picture of your crucifixion before their eyes that they may
see their sins are writ in Heaven in your blood and death and go before
them, closing off the gate and damning them to hell. Yet this is writ
in hell and not in Heaven, where you are beyond attack and prove their
*innocence*. The picture of yourself you offer them you show
*yourself* and give it all your faith. The Holy Spirit offers
you to give to them a picture of yourself in which there is no pain
and no reproach at all. And what was martyred to their guilt becomes
the perfect witness to their innocence.

The power of witness is
beyond belief because it brings conviction in its wake. The witness
is believed because they point beyond themself to what they represent. A
sick and suffering you but represents your companion’s guilt — the
witness which you send lest they forget the injuries they gave from which
you swear they never will escape. This sick and sorry picture
*you* accept, if only it can serve to punish them. The sick are
merciless to everyone, and in contagion do they seek to kill. Death
seems an easy price if they can say, “Behold me, friend; at
your hand I die”. For sickness is the witness to their guilt, and
death would prove their errors must be sins.

Sickness is but a
“little” death; a form of vengeance not yet total. Yet it
speaks with certainty for what it represents. The bleak and bitter
picture you have sent your companion *you* have looked upon in
grief. And everything that it has shown to them have you believed
because it witnessed to the guilt in them which you perceived and
loved. Now in the hands made gentle by His touch, the Holy Spirit
lays a picture of a different you. It is a picture of a body still,
for what you *really* are cannot be seen nor pictured. Yet this
one has not been used for purpose of attack and therefore never
suffered pain at all. It witnesses to the eternal truth that you
cannot *be* hurt and points beyond itself to both your innocence
and theirs.

Show *this* unto your
companions, who will see that every scar is healed and every tear is
wiped away in laughter and in love. And they will look on their
forgiveness there and with healed eyes will look beyond it to the
innocence that they behold in you. Here is the proof that they have never
sinned — that nothing which their madness bid them do was ever done or
ever had effects of any kind; that no reproach they laid upon their heart
was ever justified, and no attack can ever touch them with the
poisoned and relentless sting of fear. Attest their innocence and
*not* their guilt. *Your* healing is their comfort and their
health because it *proves* illusions are not true.

It is not will for life, but wish for death that is the motivation for this world. Its only purpose is to prove guilt real. No worldly thought or act or feeling has a motivation other than this one. These are the witnesses that are called forth to be believed and lend conviction to the system they speak for and represent. And each has many voices, speaking to your companion and yourself in different tongues. And yet to both the message is the same. Adornment of the body seeks to show how lovely are the witnesses for guilt. Concerns about the body demonstrate how frail and vulnerable is your life, how easily destroyed is what you love. Depression speaks of death and vanity of real concern with anything at all. The strongest witness to futility, which bolsters all the rest and helps them paint the picture in which sin is justified, is sickness in whatever form it takes.

The sick have reason for
each one of their unnatural desires and strange needs. For who could
live a life so soon cut short and not esteem the worth of passing
joys? What pleasures could there be that will endure? Are not the
frail entitled to believe that every stolen scrap of pleasure is
their righteous payment for their little lives? Their death will pay
the price for all of them if they enjoy their benefits or not. The
end of life must come, whatever way that life be spent. And so take
pleasure in the quickly passing and ephemeral.

These are not sins, but
witnesses unto the strange belief that sin and death are real, and
innocence and sin will end alike within the termination of the grave.
If this were true, there *would* be reason to remain content to
seek for passing joys and cherish little pleasures where you can. Yet
in this picture is the body not perceived as neutral and without a
goal inherent in itself. For it becomes the symbol of reproach, the
sign of guilt whose consequences still are there to see, so that the
cause can never be denied.

Your function is to [prove to them
that] sin can *have* no cause. How futile must it be to
see yourself a picture of the proof that what your function is can
never be! The Holy Spirit’s picture changes not the body into
something it is not. It only takes away from it all signs of
accusation and of blamefulness. Pictured without a purpose, it is
seen as neither sick nor well, nor bad nor good. No grounds are
offered that it may be judged in any way at all. It has no life, but
neither is it dead. It stands apart from all experience of fear or
love. For now it witnesses to nothing yet, its purpose being open and
the mind made free again to choose what it is *for*. Now is it
not condemned, but waiting for a purpose to be given that it may fulfil the function that it will receive.


Into this empty space,
from which the goal of sin has been removed, is Heaven free to be
remembered. Here its peace can come and perfect healing take the
place of death. The body can become a sign of life, a promise of
redemption, and a breath of immortality to those grown sick of
breathing in the fetid scent of death. Let it have healing as its
purpose. Then will it send forth the message it received and by its
health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it
represents. Let it receive the power to represent an endless life,
forever unattacked. And to your companion let its message be,
“Behold me, friend; at your hand I live”.

The simple way to let this
be achieved is merely this — to let the body have no purpose from the
past, when you were sure you knew its purpose was to foster guilt.
For this insists your crippled picture is a lasting sign of what it
represents. This leaves no space in which a different view, another
purpose, can be given it. You do *not* know its purpose. You but
gave *illusions* of a purpose to a thing you made to hide your
function from yourself. This thing without a purpose cannot hide the
function that the Holy Spirit gave. Let, then, its purpose and your
function both be reconciled at last and seen as one.
