Is healing frightening? To
many, yes. For accusation is a bar to love, and damaged bodies are
accusers. They stand firmly in the way of trust and peace,
proclaiming that the frail can have no trust and that the damaged
have no grounds for peace. Who has been injured by their companion and
could love and trust them still? They have attacked and will attack
again. Protect them not, because your damaged body shows that you must
be protected from them. To forgive may be an act of charity, but not
their due. They may be pitied for their guilt, but not exonerated. And if
you forgive them their transgressions, you but add to all the guilt that
they have really earned.

The unhealed *cannot*
pardon. For they are the witnesses that pardon is unfair. They would
retain the consequences of the guilt they overlook. Yet no one can
forgive a sin which they believe is real. And what has consequences
*must* be real because what it has done is there to see.
Forgiveness is not pity which but seeks to pardon what it knows to be
the truth. Good cannot *be* returned for evil, for forgiveness
does not first establish sin and *then* forgive it. Who can say
and mean, “My friend, you have injured me, and yet because I am
the better of the two, I pardon you my hurt”. Their pardon and
your hurt cannot exist together. One denies the other and *must*
make it false.

To witness sin and yet
forgive it is a paradox which reason cannot see. For it maintains
what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it, you
grant your companion mercy but retain the proof they are not really
innocent. The sick remain accusers. They cannot forgive their
companions and themselves as well. For no one in whom true forgiveness
reigns can suffer. They hold not the proof of sin before their
companion’s eyes. And thus they must have overlooked it and removed
it from their own. Forgiveness cannot be for one and not the other. Who
forgives *is* healed. And in their healing lies the proof that they
have truly pardoned and retains no trace of condemnation that they still
would hold against themself or any living thing.

Forgiveness is not
real *unless* it brings a healing to your companion *and*
yourself. You must attest their sins had no effect on you to
demonstrate they were not real. How else could they be guiltless? And
how could their innocence be justified unless their sins have no effect
to warrant guilt? Sins are beyond forgiveness just because they would
entail effects which cannot be undone and overlooked entirely. In
their undoing lies the proof that they were merely errors. *Let*
yourself be healed that you may be forgiving, offering salvation to
your companion and yourself. A broken body shows the mind has not been
healed. A miracle of healing proves that separation is without
effect. What you would prove to them, you will believe. The power of
witness *comes* from your belief. And everything you say or do
or think but testifies to what you teach to them.

Your body can be means to
teach that it has never suffered pain because of them. And in its
healing can it offer them mute testimony of their innocence. It is this
testimony which can speak with power greater than a thousand tongues.
For here is their forgiveness *proved* to them. A miracle can offer
nothing less to them than it has given unto you. So does your healing
show your mind is healed and has forgiven what they did not do. And so
are they convinced their innocence was never lost and healed along with
you.

Thus does the miracle undo
all things the world attests can never *be* undone. And
hopelessness and death must disappear before the ancient clarion call
of life. This call has power far beyond the weak and miserable cry of
death and guilt. The ancient calling of the Mother to Her Child, and of
the Child unto their own, will yet be the last trumpet that the world
will ever hear. Friend, there *is* no death. And this you learn
when you but wish to show your companions that you had no hurt of them.
They think your blood is on their hands, and so they stand condemned. Yet
it is given you to show them by your healing that their guilt is but the
fabric of a senseless dream.

How just are miracles! For
they bestow an equal gift of full deliverance from guilt upon your
companions and yourself. Your healing saves them pain as well as you, and
you are healed because you wished them well. This is the law the
miracle obeys; that healing sees no specialness at all. It does not
come from pity but from love. And love would prove all suffering is
but a vain imagining, a foolish wish with no effects. Your health is
a result of your desire to see your companions with no blood upon their
hands nor guilt upon their heart made heavy with the proof of sin. And
what you wish *is* given you to see.

The “cost” of
your serenity is theirs. This is the “price” the Holy Spirit
and the world interpret differently. The world perceives it as a
statement of the “fact” that your salvation
*sacrifices* theirs. The Holy Spirit *knows* your healing is
the witness unto theirs and cannot be apart from theirs at all. As long as
they consent to suffer, you will be unhealed. Yet you can show them
that their suffering is purposeless and wholly without cause. Show them
your healing, and they will consent no more to suffer. For their
innocence has been established in your sight and theirs. And laughter
will replace your sighs because God’s Child remembered that they 
*are* God’s Child.

Who then fears healing? Only those to whom their companions’ sacrifice and pain are seen to represent their [those to whom] own serenity. Their helplessness and weakness represent the grounds on which they *justify* their pain. The
constant sting of guilt they suffer serves to prove that they are slave
but they are free. The constant pain they suffer demonstrates that
they are free *because* they hold them [companions] bound. And 
sickness is desired to prevent a shift of balance in the sacrifice. How 
could the Holy Spirit be deterred an instant, even less, to reason with an
argument for sickness such as this? And need your healing be delayed
because you pause to listen to insanity?

[Correction is *not*
your function. It belongs to One Who knows of fairness, *not* of
guilt. If you assume correction’s role, you *lose* the
function of forgiveness. No one can forgive until they learn
correction is *but* to forgive and *never* to accuse.
Alone, you *cannot* see they are the same, and therefore is
correction *not* of you. Identity and function are the same, and
*by* your function do you know yourself. And thus, if you
confuse your function with the function of Another, you *must*
be confused about yourself and who you are. What is the separation
but a wish to take God’s function from Her and *deny* that
it is Hers? Yet if it is *not* Hers, it is not *yours*, for
*you* must lose what you would take away.

[In a split mind,
identity *must* seem to be divided. Nor can anyone perceive a
function unified which has conflicting purposes and different ends.
Correction, to a mind so split, *must* be a way to punish sins
you think are *yours* in someone else. And thus do they become
your victim, *not* your companion, *different* from you in
that they are *more guilty*, thus in need of your correction as the
one *more innocent* than they. This splits *their* function off
from yours and gives you both a *different* role. And so you
*cannot* be perceived as one, and with a single function that would *mean* a shared identity with but *one* end.

[Correction *you*
would do *must* separate, because that is the function given it
*by* you. When you perceive correction is the *same* as
pardon, then you also know the Holy Spirit’s Mind and yours are
one. And so your *own* Identity is found. Yet must He work with
what is *given* Him, and you allow Him only *half* your
mind. And thus He represents the *other* half and seems to have
a *different* purpose from the one you cherish and you
*think* is yours. Thus does your function seem *divided*,
with a half *in opposition* to a half. And these two halves
appear to represent a split within a self perceived as two.]

Consider how this self-perception must extend, and do not overlook the fact that every
thought extends because that is its purpose, being what it
really *is*. From an idea of self as two, there comes a necessary view
of function split between the two. And what you would correct is only
half the error, which you think is all of it. Your companions’ sins
become the central target for correction, lest your errors and their
own be seen as one. Yours are mistakes, but theirs are sins and not the
same as yours. Theirs merit punishment, while yours in fairness should
be overlooked.

In this interpretation of
correction, your own mistakes you will not even see. The focus of
correction has been placed outside yourself on one who cannot be a
part of you while this perception lasts. What is condemned can never
be returned to its accuser, who hated it and hates it still. This is
your companion, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part of you and thus
outside yourself—the other half which is denied. And only what is
left without their presence is perceived as all of you. To this
remaining half the Holy Spirit must represent the other half until
you recognize it *is* the other half. And this He does by giving
both of you a function that is one, not different.

Correction is the function
given *both*, but neither one alone. And when it is fulfilled as
*shared*, it *must* correct mistakes in both of you. It cannot leave mistakes in one unhealed and set the other free. That is divided purpose which cannot be shared, and so it cannot be the function which the Holy Spirit sees as His. And you can rest assured that He will not fulfil a function that He cannot understand and recognize as His. For only thus can He keep yours preserved intact, despite your separated view of what your function is. If He upheld divided function, you were lost indeed. His inability to see His goal divided and distinct for each of you preserves your Self from being made aware of any function other than Its own. And thus is healing given both of you.

Correction must be left to
One Who knows correction and forgiveness are the same. With half a
mind, this is not understood. Leave then correction to the Mind that
*is* united, functioning as one because It is not split in
purpose, and conceives a single function as Its *only* one. Here
is the function given It conceived to be Its own and not apart from
that Its Giver keeps *because* it has been shared. In His
acceptance of this function lies the means whereby your mind is
unified. His single purpose unifies the halves of you which you
perceive as separate. And each forgives the other, that they may accept
their other half as part of them.
