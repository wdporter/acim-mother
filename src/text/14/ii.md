The guiltless and the
guilty are totally incapable of understanding one another. Each
perceives the other as like themself, making them unable to
communicate because each sees the other *unlike* the way they sees
*themself.* God can communicate *only* to the Holy Spirit in
your mind because only He shares the knowledge of what you are with
God. And only the Holy Spirit can *answer* God for you, for only
He knows what God *is.* Everything else that you have placed
within your mind *cannot* exist, for what is not in
communication with the Mind of God has never been. Communication with
God is life. Nothing without it *is* at all.

The only part of your mind
that has reality is the part which links you still with God. Would
you have *all* of it transformed into a radiant message of
God’s Love, to share with all the lonely ones who denied Her with
you? *God makes this possible*. Would you deny Her yearning to
be known? You yearn for Her, as She for you. This is forever
changeless. Accept, then, the immutable. Leave the world of death
behind, and return quietly to Heaven. There is *nothing* of
value here and *everything* of value there. Listen to the Holy
Spirit and to God through Him. He speaks of you to *you*. There
*is* no guilt in you, for God is blessed in Her Child as the Child
is blessed in Her.

Each one of you has a
special part to play in the Atonement, but the message given to each
to share is always the same — *God’s Child is guiltless.*
Each one teaches the message differently and learns it differently.
Yet until they teach it and learn it, they will suffer the pain of dim
awareness that their true function remains unfulfilled in them. The
burden of guilt is heavy, but God would not have you bound by it. Her
plan for your awaking is as perfect as yours is fallible. You know
not what you do, but She Who knows is with you. Her gentleness is
yours, and all the love you share with God She holds in trust for you.
She would teach you nothing except how to be happy.

Blessed Child of a wholly
blessing Mother, joy was created for *you.* Who can condemn whom
God has blessed? There is nothing in the Mind of God that does not
share Her shining innocence. Creation is the natural extension of
perfect purity. Your only calling here is to devote yourself with
active willingness to the denial of guilt in *all* its forms. To accuse
is *not to understand*. The happy learners of the Atonement
become the teachers of the innocence that is the right of all that
God created. Deny them not what is their due, for you will not withhold it from them alone.


The inheritance of the
Realm is the right of God’s Child, given them in their creation. Do
not try to steal it from them, or you will *ask* for guilt and
*will* experience it. Protect their purity from every thought that
would steal it away and keep it from their sight. Bring innocence to
light in answer to the call of the Atonement. Never allow purity to
remain hidden, but shine away the heavy veils of guilt within which
the Child of God has hidden themself from their own sight. We are all
joined in the Atonement here, and nothing else can unite us in this
world. So will the world of separation slip away and full
communication be restored between the Mother and the Child.

The miracle acknowledges
the guiltlessness which *must* have been denied to produce
*need* of healing. Do not withhold this glad acknowledgment, for
hope of happiness and release from suffering of every kind lie in it.
Who is there but wishes to be free of pain? They may not yet have
learned *how* to exchange their guilt for innocence nor realise
that only in this exchange can freedom from pain be theirs. Yet those
who have failed to learn need *teaching, not* attack. To attack
those who have need of teaching is to fail to learn from them.

Teachers of innocence,
each in their own way, have joined together, taking their part in the
unified curriculum of the Atonement. There is no unity of learning
goals apart from this. There is no conflict in this curriculum, which
has *one* aim however it is taught. Each effort made on its
behalf is offered for the single purpose of *release* from guilt
to the eternal glory of God and Her creation. And every teaching that
points to this points straight to Heaven and to the peace of God.
There is no pain, no trial, no fear that teaching this can fail to
overcome. The power of God Herself supports this teaching and
*guarantees* its limitless results.

Join your own efforts to
the power that *cannot* fail and *must* result in peace. No
one can be untouched by teaching such as this. You will not see
yourself beyond the power of God if you teach only this. You will not
be exempt from the effects of this most holy lesson, which seeks but
to restore what is the right of God’s creation. From everyone
whom you accord release from guilt, you will inevitably learn
*your* innocence. The circle of Atonement *has* no end. And
you will find ever-increasing confidence in your safe inclusion in
what is for all in everyone you bring within its safety and its
perfect peace.

Peace, then, be unto
everyone who becomes a teacher of peace. For peace is the
acknowledgment of perfect purity from which no one is excluded.
Within its holy circle is everyone whom God created as Her Son. Joy
is its unifying attribute, with no one left outside to suffer guilt
alone. The power of God draws everyone to its safe embrace of love
and union. Stand quietly within this circle and attract all tortured
minds to join with you in the safety of its peace and holiness. Abide
with me within it as teachers of Atonement, *not* of guilt.

Blessed are you who teach
with me. Our power comes not of us but of our Mother. In
guiltlessness we know Her, as She knows us guiltless. I stand within
the circle, calling you to peace. Teach peace with me and stand with
me on holy ground. Remember for everyone your Mother’s power that
She has given them. Believe not that you cannot teach Her perfect
peace. Stand not outside but join with me within. Fail not the only
purpose to which my teaching calls you. Restore to God Her Child as She
created them by teaching them their innocence.

The crucifixion has no
part in the Atonement. Only the resurrection became my part in it.
That is the symbol of the release from guilt by guiltlessness. Whom
you perceive as guilty, you would crucify. Yet you *restore*
guiltlessness to whomever you see as guiltless. Crucifixion is
*always* the ego’s aim. It sees *as guilty,* and by its
condemnation, it would kill. The Holy Spirit sees only guiltlessness,
and in His gentleness, He would release from fear and reestablish the
reign of love. The power of love is in His gentleness, which is of
God and therefore cannot crucify nor suffer crucifixion. The temple
you restore becomes *your* altar, for it was rebuilt through
you. And everything you give to God *is* yours. Thus She creates,
and thus must *you* restore.

Each one you see you place
within the holy circle of Atonement or leave outside, judging them fit
for crucifixion or for redemption. If you bring them *into* the
circle of purity, you will rest there with them. If you leave them
*without*, you join them there. Judge not except in quietness
which is not of you. Refuse to accept anyone as *without* the
blessing of Atonement, and bring them *into* it by blessing them.
Holiness must be shared, for therein lies everything that makes it
holy. Come gladly to the holy circle, and look out in peace on all
who think they are outside. Cast no one out, for this is what they
seek, along with you. Come, let us join them in the holy place of
peace, which is for all of us, united as one within the cause of
peace.
