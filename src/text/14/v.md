The Atonement does not *make* holy. You were *created* holy. It merely brings unholiness *to* holiness, or what you *made* to what you *are*. The bringing together of truth and illusion, of the ego to God, is the Holy Spirit’s only function. Keep not your making from your Mother, for hiding it has cost you knowledge of Her and of yourselves. The knowledge is safe, but whereïn is *your* safety apart from it? The making of time to *take the place* of timelessness lay in the decision to be not as you were. Thus, truth was made past, and the present was dedicated to illusion. And the past, too, was changed and interposed between what always was and *now*. The past which *you* remember *never* was and represents only the denial of what *always* was.

Bringing the ego to God is but to bring error to truth, where it stands corrected because it is the *opposite* of what it meets and is undone, because the contradiction can no longer stand. How long can contradiction stand when its impossible nature is clearly revealed? What disappears in light is not attacked. It merely vanishes because it is not true. Different realities are meaningless, for reality must be one. It *cannot* change with time or mood or chance. Its changelessness is what *makes* it real. This cannot *be* undone. Undoing is for unreality. And this reality *will* do for you.

Merely by being what it is does truth release you from everything that it is *not*. The Atonement is so gentle you need but whisper to it, and all its power will rush to your assistance and support. You are not frail with God beside you. Yet without Her you are nothing. The Atonement offers you God. The gift which you refused is held by Her in you. Her Spirit holds it there for you. God has not left Her altar, though Her worshipper placed other gods upon it. The temple still is holy, for the Presence that dwells within it *is* Holiness.

In the temple Holiness waits quietly for the return of them that love it. The Presence knows they will return to purity and to grace. The graciousness of God will take them gently in and cover all their sense of pain and loss with the immortal assurance of their Mother’s Love. There, fear of death will be replaced with joy of living. For God is Life, and they *abide* in Life.  [Life is as holy as the Holiness by which it was created.] The Presence of Holiness lives in everything that lives, for Holiness *created* life and leaves not what It
created holy as Itself.

In this world you can become a spotless mirror in which the Holiness of your Creator shines forth from you to all around you. You can reflect Heaven *here*. Yet no reflections of the images of other gods must dim the mirror that would hold God’s reflection in it. Earth can reflect Heaven or hell; God or the ego. You need but leave the mirror clean and clear of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it. God will shine upon it of Herself. Only the clear reflection of Herself can *be* perceived upon it. Reflections are seen in light. In darkness they are obscure, and their meaning seems to lie only in shifting interpretations rather than in themselves.

The reflection of God *needs* no interpretation. It is *clear.* Clean but the mirror, and the message which shines forth from what the mirror holds out for everyone to see no one can *fail* to understand. It is the message that the Holy Spirit is holding to the mirror that is in them. They recognise it because they have been taught their *need* for it but know not where to look to find it. Let them, then, see it in *you* and *share* it with you.

Could you but realise for a single instant the power of healing that the reflection of God, shining in you, can bring to all the world, you could not wait to make the mirror of your mind clean to receive the image of the holiness that heals the world. The image of holiness which shines in your mind is not obscure and will not change. Its meaning to those who look upon it is not obscure, for everyone perceives it as the *same*. All bring their different problems to its healing light, but all their problems are met *only* with healing there.

The response of holiness to *any* form of error is always the same. There is no contradiction in what holiness calls forth. Its *one* response is healing, without regard for what is brought to it. Those who have learned to offer only healing because of the reflection of holiness in them are ready at last for Heaven. There, holiness is not a reflection but rather the actual condition of what was but reflected to them here. God is no image, and Her creations, as part of Her, hold Her in them in truth. They do not merely *reflect* truth,
for they *are* truth.
