The darkest of your hidden
cornerstones holds your belief in guilt from your awareness. For in
that dark and secret place is the realisation that you have betrayed
God’s Child by condemning them to death. You do not even suspect
this murderous but insane idea lies hidden there, for the ego’s
destructive urge is so intense that nothing short of the crucifixion
of God’s Child can ultimately satisfy it. It does not know who the
Child of God is because it is blind. Yet let it perceive guiltlessness
anywhere, and it will try to destroy it because it is afraid.

Much of the ego’s
strange behaviour is directly attributable to its definition of guilt.
To the ego, *the guiltless are guilty*. Those who do not attack
are its “enemies” because, by not valuing its
interpretation of salvation, they are in an excellent position *to
let it go*. They have approached the darkest and deepest
cornerstone in the ego’s foundation, and while the ego can
withstand your raising all else to question, it guards this one
secret with its life, for its existence *does* depend on keeping
this secret. So it is this secret that we must look upon calmly, for
the ego cannot protect you against truth, and in *its* presence
the ego is dispelled.

In the calm light of truth, let us recognise that you believe you *have* 
crucified God’s Child. You have not admitted to this “terrible” secret 
because you *still* wish to crucify them if you could *find* 
them. Yet the wish has hidden them from you because it is very fearful, 
and you are *afraid* to find them. You have handled this wish to 
kill *yourself* by *not knowing* who you are and 
identifying with something *else*. You have projected guilt 
blindly and indiscriminately, but you have *not* uncovered its 
source. For the ego *does* want to kill you, and if you identify 
*with* it, you must believe *its* goal is *yours.*

We once said that the crucifixion is the symbol of the ego. When it was 
confronted with the *real* guiltlessness of God’s Child, it *did* attempt to 
kill them, and the reason it gave was that guiltlessness is 
blasphemous to God. To the ego *the ego* is god, and 
guiltlessness *must* be interpreted as the final guilt which 
fully justifies murder. You do not yet understand that all your fear 
of this course stems ultimately from this interpretation, but if you 
will consider your reäctions to it, you will become increasingly 
convinced that this is so.

This course has explicitly stated that its goal for you is happiness and peace. Yet 
you are *afraid* of it. You have been told again and again that it will 
make you free, yet you reäct as if it is trying to imprison you. Most 
of the time you dismiss it, but you do *not* dismiss the 
*ego’s* thought system. You have *seen* its results and 
you *still* lack faith in it. You *must*, then, believe 
that by *not* learning the course, you are *protecting* 
yourself. And you do not realise that it is only your guiltlessness 
which *can* protect you.

The Atonement has always been interpreted as the release from guilt, and this 
is correct if it is understood. Yet even when I have interpreted it *for* you,
you have rejected it and have *not* accepted it for yourself.
You have recognised the futility of the ego and its offerings, but
though you do not want the ego, you do not look upon the alternative
with gladness. You are *afraid* of redemption, and you believe
it will kill you. Make no mistake about the depth of your fear. For
you believe that in the presence of truth you will turn on yourself
and destroy yourself.

Little children, this is
not so. Your “guilty secret” is nothing, and if you will
but bring it to the light, the light will dispel it. And then no dark
cloud will remain between you and the remembrance of your Mother, for
you will remember Her guiltless Child, who did not die, because they are
immortal. And you will see that you were redeemed *with* them and
have never been separated *from* them. In this understanding lies
your remembering, for it is the recognition of love *without*
fear. There will be great joy in Heaven on your homecoming, and the
joy will be *yours*. For the redeemed son of man [sic] *is* the
guiltless Child of God, and to recognise them *is* your
redemption.
