Prayer has both aids and witnesses which make the steep
ascent more gentle and more sure, easing the pain of fear and
offering the comfort and the promises of hope. Forgivenessʹs
witness and an aid to prayer, a giver of assurance of success in
ultimate attainment of the goal, is healing. Its importance should
not be too strongly emphasized, for healing is a sign or symbol of
forgivenessʹs strength, and only an effect or shadow of a change of
mind about the goal of prayer.
