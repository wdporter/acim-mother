Prayer is the greatest gift with which God blessed Her Son at his creation. It was then what it is to become; the single voice Creator and creation share; the song the Son sings to the Mother, Who returns the thanks it offers Her unto the Son. Endless the harmony, and endless, too, the joyous concord of the Love They give forever to Each Other. And in this, creation is extended. God gives thanks to Her extension in Her Son. Her Son gives thanks for his creation, in the song of his creating in his Mother’s Name. The Love They share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time is done. For such it was before time seemed to be.

To you who are in time a little while, prayer takes the form that best will suit your need. You have but one. What God created one must recognize its oneness, and rejoice that what illusions seemed to separate is one forever in the Mind of God. Prayer now must be the means by which God’s Son leaves separate goals and separate interests by, and turns in holy gladness to the truth of union in his Mother and himself.

Lay down your dreams, you holy Son of God, and rising up as God created you, dispense with idols and remember Her. Prayer will sustain you now, and bless you as you lift your heart to Her in rising song that reaches higher and then higher still, until both high and low have disappeared. Faith in your goal will grow and hold you up as you ascend the shining stairway to the lawns of Heaven and the gate of peace. For this is prayer, and here salvation is. This is the way. It is God’s gift to you. {% include "acim-org-link", pageNumber: pageNumber, reference: reference  %}
