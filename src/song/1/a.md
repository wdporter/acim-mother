Prayer is the greatest gift with which God blessed Her Child
at their creation. It was then what it is to become; the single Voice
Creator and creation share; the song the Child sings to the Mother,
Who returns the thanks it offers Her unto the Child. Endless the
harmony, and endless too the joyous concord of the Love They give
forever to each other. And in this creation is extended. God gives
thanks to Her extension in Her Child. Her Child gives thanks for their
creation, in the song of their creating in their Motherʹs Name. The Love
They share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time
is done. For such it was before time seemed to be.

To you who are in time a little while, prayer takes the form
that best will suit your need. You have but one. What God created
one must recognise its oneness, and rejoice that what illusions
seemed to separate is one forever in the Mind of God. Prayer now
must be the means by which Godʹs Child leaves separate goals and
separate interests by, and turns in holy gladness to the truth of
union in their Mother and themself.

Lay down your dreams, you holy Child of God, and rising up
as God created you, dispense with idols and remember Her. Prayer
will sustain you now, and bless you as you lift your hearts to Her
in rising song that reaches higher and then higher still until both
high and low have disappeared. Faith in your goal will grow and
hold you up as you ascend the shining stairway to the lawns of
Heaven and the gate of peace. For this is prayer, and here salvation
is. This is the way. It is Godʹs gift to you.

Asking is holy, and it is holy because it is a way of reaching
God. She is the Answerer because you are in need of an Answer.
No‐one can ask for another and receive the Answer for them. But
you can, and indeed you must, help them by offering your love and
support that their answer be holy and their true need recognised. That
is prayer; it is the same for yourself or for another. There is no
difference. If you received the answers for another, there would be a
difference.

This does not mean that you cannot get messages for
another, if it is God Who chooses this way of reaching them. This
will usually happen unexpectedly, generally in the form of a sudden
feeling that you have something to tell them; a message to deliver.
You have not been wrong in the past about how you have asked,
but you are ready for a step ahead now. There are joint decisions in
which unanimity of response is a good indication of authenticity.
This should not be abandoned. But asking is a lesson in trust, and
no‐one can trust for another. They can only strengthen another’s trust
by offering it to them and having faith in their ability to hear for
themself.

Asking is the way to God because it offers us Her Will as
She would have us hear it. We will have a series of lessons on
asking because you have not understood it. But do not think
because of that that you have been mistaken in your attempts. You
have done well and will do better.

Any specific question involves a large number of
assumptions which inevitably limit the answer. A specific question
is actually a decision about the kind of answer that is acceptable.
The purpose of words is to limit, and by limiting to make a vast area
of experience more manageable. But that means manageable by
*you*. For many aspects of living in this world that is necessary. But
not for asking. God does not use words and does not answer in
words. She can only “speak” to the Christ in you, Who translates
Her Answer into whatever language you can understand and
accept. Sometimes words will limit fear; sometimes not. That is
why some people hear words, some receive feelings of inner
conviction, and some do not become aware of anything. Yet God
has answered, and Her Answer will reach you when you are ready.

Answers are not up to you. Any limit you place on them
interferes with hearing. God’s Voice is silent and speaks in silence.
That means that you do not phrase the question and you do not
restrict the answer.

Asking is prayer. It is not a demand. It is not questioning.
It is not limitation. The only real request is for God’s Answer. It
needs the humility of trust, not the arrogance of false certainty.
Trust cannot lie in idols, for that is merely faith in magic. Trust
requires faith that God understands, knows, and will answer. It
means a state of peace. For this you can safely ask. In fact, if you
do not feel that you have it, asking for it is the only real request
you can make.
