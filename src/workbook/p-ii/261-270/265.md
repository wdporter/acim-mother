I have indeed misunderstood the world because I laid my “sins” on it and saw 
them looking back at me. How fierce they seemed! And how deceived was I to 
think that what I feared was in the world instead of in my mind alone. Today I 
see the world in the celestial gentleness with which creation shines. There is no 
fear in it. Let no appearance of my “sins” obscure the light of Heaven, shining on 
the world. What is reflected here is in God’s Mind. The images I see reflect my 
thoughts. Yet is my mind at one with God’s. And so I can perceive creation’s 
gentleness.

*In quiet would I look upon the world, which but reflects Your Thoughts and 
mine as well. Let me remember that they are the same, and I will see creation’s 
gentleness.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}
