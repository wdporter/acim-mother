My oneness with the Christ establishes me as Your Child, beyond the reach of 
time and wholly free of every law but Yours. I have no self except the Christ in 
me. I have no purpose but His own. And He is like His Mother. Thus must I be 
one with You as well as Him. For who is Christ except Your Child as You created 
Them? And what am I except the Christ in me?
