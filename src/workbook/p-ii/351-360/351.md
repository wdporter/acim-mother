*Who is my companion but Your holy Child? And if I see them sinful, I proclaim 
myself a sinner, not a Child of God, alone and friendless in a fearful world. 
Yet this perception is a choice I make and can relinquish. I can also see my 
companion sinless as Your holy Child. And with this choice I see my sinlessness, 
my everlasting Comforter and Friend beside me, and my way secure and clear. 
Choose, then, for me, my Mother, through Your Voice. For He alone gives 
judgement in Your Name.*
