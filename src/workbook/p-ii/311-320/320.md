The Child of God is limitless. There are no limits on their strength, their peace, their joy, or any attributes their Mother gave in their creation. What they will with their Creator and Redeemer must be done. Their holy will can never be denied because their Mother shines upon their mind and lays before it all the strength and love in earth and Heaven. I am they to whom all this is given. I am they in whom the power of my Mother's Will abides.

*Your Will can do all things in me and then extend to all the world as well through me. There is no limit on Your Will. And so all power has been given to Your Child.*
