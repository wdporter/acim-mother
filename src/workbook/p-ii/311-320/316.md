As every gift my companions give is mine, so every gift I give belongs to me. 
Each one allows a past mistake to go and leave no shadow on the holy mind 
my Mother loves. Her grace is given me in every gift a companion has 
received throughout all time and past all time as well. My treasure house is 
full, and angels watch its open doors that not one gift is lost and only more 
are added. Let me come to where my treasures are and enter in where I am 
truly welcome and at home among the gifts that God has given me.

*Mother, I would accept Your gifts today. I do not recognise them. Yet I trust 
that You Who gave them will provide the means by which I can behold them, 
see their worth, and cherish only them as what I want.*
