This is the thought that can be used to say that death and sorrow are the certain 
lot of all who come here. For their joys are gone before they are possessed, or 
even grasped. Yet this is also the idea that lets no false perception keep us in its 
hold nor represent more than a passing cloud upon a sky eternally serene. And 
it is this serenity we seek, unclouded, obvious and sure today.

*We seek Your holy world today. For we, Your loving Children, have lost our way 
a while. But we have listened to Your Voice and learned exactly what to do to be 
restored to Heaven and our true Identity. And we give thanks today the world 
endures but for an instant. We would go beyond that tiny instant to eternity.* {.ml-12 .mr-12}
