My gratitude permits my love to be accepted without fear. And thus am I 
restored to my Reality at last. All that intruded on my holy sight forgiveness 
takes away. And I draw near the end of senseless journeys, mad careers and 
artificial values. I accept instead what God establishes as mine, sure that in that 
alone I will be saved, sure that I go through fear to meet my Love.

*Mother, I come to You today, because I would not follow any way but Yours. 
You are beside me. Certain is Your way. And I am grateful for Your holy gifts of 
certain sanctuary and escape from everything that would obscure my love for 
God, my Mother, and Her holy Child.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}
