*Mother, it is today that I am free because my will is Yours. I thought to make 
another will. Yet nothing that I thought apart from You exists. And I am free 
because I was mistaken and did not affect my own reality at all by my illusions. 
Now I give them up and lay them down before the feet of truth, to be removed 
forever from my mind. This is my holy instant of release. Mother, I know my will 
is one with Yours.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

And so today we find our glad return to Heaven, which we never really left. The 
Child of God this day lays down their dreams. The Child of God this day comes 
home again, released from sin and clad in holiness, with their right mind restored to them at last.
