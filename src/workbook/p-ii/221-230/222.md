God is with me. She is my Source of life, the life within, the air I breathe, the food by which I am sustained, the water which renews and cleanses me. She is my home, wherein I live and move; the Spirit which directs my actions, offers me Its Thoughts, and guarantees my safety from all pain. She covers me with kindness and with care, and holds in love the Son She shines upon, who also shines on Her. How still are they who know the truth of what She speaks today!

*Mother, we have no words except Your Name upon our lips and in our minds, as we come quietly into Your Presence now, and ask to rest with You in peace a while.*
