God is with me. She is my Source of life, the life within, the air I breathe, the 
food by which I am sustained, the water which renews and cleanses me. She 
is my home, whereïn I live and move, the Spirit Which directs my actions, 
offers me Its Thoughts, and guarantees my safety from all pain. She covers 
me with kindness and with care and holds in love the Child She shines upon, 
who also shines on Her. How still are they who know the truth of what She 
speaks today!

*Mother, we have no words except Your Name upon our lips and in our 
minds as we come quietly into Your Presence now and ask to rest with You in 
peace a while.*
