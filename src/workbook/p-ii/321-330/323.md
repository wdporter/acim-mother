*Here is the only “sacrifice” You ask of Your beloved Child — You ask them to 
give up all suffering, all sense of loss and sadness, all anxiety and doubt and 
freely let Your Love come streaming in to their awareness, healing them of pain 
and giving them Your own eternal joy. Such is the “sacrifice” You ask of me, and 
one I gladly make, the only “cost” of restoration of Your memory to me for the salvation of the world.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

And as we pay the debt we owe to truth — a debt which merely is the letting-go 
of self-deceptions and of images we worshipped falsely — truth returns to us in 
wholeness and in joy. We are deceived no longer. Love has now returned to our 
awareness. And we are at peace again, for fear has gone and only love remains.
