This is salvation's keynote: What I see reflects a process in my mind which  starts with my idea of what I want. From there, the mind makes up an image of the thing the mind desires, judges valuable, and therefore seeks to find. These images are then projected outward, looked upon, esteemed as real, and guarded as one’s own. From insane wishes comes an insane world. From judgement comes a world condemned. And from forgiving thoughts a gentle world comes forth, with mercy for the holy Child of God, to offer them a kindly home where they can rest a while before they journey on and help their companion walk ahead with them and find the way to Heaven and to God.

*Our Mother, Your Ideas reflect the truth, and mine apart from Yours but make up dreams. Let me behold what only Yours reflect, for Yours and Yours alone establish truth.*
