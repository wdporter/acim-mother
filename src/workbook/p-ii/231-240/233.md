*Mother, I give You all my thoughts today. I would have none of mine. In 
place of them, give me Your own. I give You all my acts as well that I may do 
Your Will instead of seeking goals which cannot be obtained and wasting time 
in vain imaginings. Today I come to You. I will step back and merely follow 
You. Be You the Guide and I the follower who questions not the wisdom of 
the Infinite nor Love Whose tenderness I cannot comprehend but which is 
yet Your perfect gift to me.*

Today we have one Guide to lead us on. And as we walk together, we will give 
this day to Him with no reserve at all. This is His day. And so it is a day of 
countless gifts and mercies unto us.
