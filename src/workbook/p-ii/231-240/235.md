I need but look upon all things that seem to hurt me and with perfect certainty 
assure myself, “God wills that I be saved from this”, and merely watch them 
disappear. I need but keep in mind my Mother’s Will for me is only happiness to 
find that only happiness has come to me. And I need but remember that Her 
Love surrounds Her Child and keeps their sinlessness forever perfect to be sure 
that I am saved and safe forever in Her arms. I am the Child She loves. And I am 
saved because God in Her mercy wills it so.

*Mother, Your holiness is mine. Your Love created me and made my sinlessness 
forever part of You. I have no guilt nor sin in me, for there is none in You.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}
