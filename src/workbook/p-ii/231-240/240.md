Fear is deception. It attests that you have seen yourself as you could never be and therefore look upon a world which is impossible. Not one thing in this world is true. It does not matter what the form in which it may appear. It witnesses but to your own illusions of yourself. Let us not be deceived today. We are the Child of God. There is no fear in us, for we are each a part of Love Itself.

*How foolish are our fears! Would You allow Your Child to suffer? Give us faith today to recognise Your Child and set them free. Let us forgive them in Your Name, that we may understand their holiness and feel the love for them that is Your own as well.*
