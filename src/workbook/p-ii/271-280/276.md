What is the Word of God? “My Child is pure and holy as Myself”. And thus did 
God become the Mother of the Child She loves, for thus were they created. This 
the Word Her Child did not create with Her because in this Her Child was born. 
Let us accept Her Motherhood, and all is given us. Deny we were created in Her 
Love, and we deny our Self, to be unsure of who we are, of who our Mother is, 
and for what purpose we have come. And yet we need but to acknowledge Her 
Who gave Her Word to us in our creation, to remember Her and so recall our 
Self.

*Mother, Your Word is mine. And it is this that I would speak to all my 
companions, who are given me to cherish as my own, as I am loved and blessed 
and saved by You.* {.ml-12 .mr-12}
