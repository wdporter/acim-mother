*Your Child is free, my Mother. Let me not imagine I have bound them with the 
laws I made to rule the body. They are not subject to any laws I made by which I 
try to make the body more secure. They are not changed by what is changeable. 
They are not slave to any laws of time. They are as You created them because they know no laws except the Law of Love.* {.ml-12 .mr-12}

Let us not worship idols, nor believe in any laws idolatry would make to hide the 
freedom of the Child of God. They are not bound except by their beliefs. Yet 
what they are is far beyond their faith in slavery or freedom. They are free 
because they are their Mother’s Child. And they can not be bound unless God’s 
Truth can lie and God can will that She deceive Herself.
