Whom God created limitless is free. I can invent imprisonment for him, but only in illusions, not in truth. No Thought of God has left its Mother’s Mind. No Thought of God is limited at all. No Thought of God but is forever pure. Can I lay limits on the Son of God, whose Mother willed that he be limitless, and like Herself in freedom and in love?

*Today let me give honour to Your Son, for thus alone I find the way to You. Mother, I lay no limits on the Son You love and You created limitless. The honour that I give to him is Yours, and what is Yours belongs to me as well.*
