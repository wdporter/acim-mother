Whom God created limitless is free. I can invent imprisonment for them, but 
only in illusions, not in truth. No Thought of God has left its Mother’s Mind. No 
Thought of God is limited at all. No Thought of God but is forever pure. Can I lay 
limits on the Child of God, whose Mother willed that they be limitless and like 
Herself in freedom and in love?

*Today let me give honour to Your Child, for thus alone I find the way to You. 
Mother, I lay no limits on the Child You love and You created limitless. The 
honour that I give to them is Yours, and what is Yours belongs to me as well.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}
