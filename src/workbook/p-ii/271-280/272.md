*Mother, the truth belongs to me. My home is set in Heaven by Your Will and 
mine. Can dreams content me? Can illusions bring me happiness? What but 
Your memory can satisfy Your Child? I will accept no less than You have given 
me. I am surrounded by Your Love, forever still, forever gentle, and forever safe. 
God’s Child must be as You created them.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

Today we pass illusions by. And if we hear temptation call to us to stay and 
linger in a dream, we turn aside and ask ourselves if we, the Children of God, 
could be content with dreams when Heaven can be chosen just as easily as hell 
and love will happily replace all fear.
