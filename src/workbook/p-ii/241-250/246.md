Let me not think that I can find the way to God, if I have hatred in my heart. Let me not try to hurt God’s Son, and think that I can know his Mother or my Self. Let me not fail to recognize myself, and still believe that my awareness can contain my Mother, or my mind conceive of all the love my Mother has for me, and all the love which I return to Her.

*I will accept the way You choose for me to come to You, my Mother. For in that will I succeed, because it is Your Will. And I would recognize that what You will is what I will as well, and only that. And so I choose to love Your Son. Amen.*
