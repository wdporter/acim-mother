Let me not think that I can find the way to God if I have hatred in my heart. 
Let me not try to hurt God’s Child and think that I can know their Mother or 
my Self. Let me not fail to recognise myself and still believe that my 
awareness can contain my Mother, or my mind conceive of all the love my 
Mother has for me and all the love which I return to Her.

*I will accept the way You choose for me to come to You, my Mother. For in 
that will I succeed because it is Your Will. And I would recognise that what 
You will is what I will as well and only that. And so I choose to love Your Child. 
Amen.*
