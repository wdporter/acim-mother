Let me behold the Child of God today and witness to their glory. Let me not 
try to obscure the holy light in them and see their strength diminished and 
reduced to frailty nor perceive the lacks in them with which I would attack 
their sovereignty.

*They are Your Child, my Mother. And today I would behold their gentleness 
instead of my illusions. They are what I am, and as I see them, so I see myself. 
Today I would see truly that this day I may at last identify with them.*
