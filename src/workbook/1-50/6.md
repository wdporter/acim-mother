The exercises with this idea are very similar to the preceding ones. Again, it is necessary to name both the form of upset (anger, fear, worry, depression and so on) and the perceived source very specifically for any application of the idea. For example:

*I am angry at _________ because I see something that is not there.\
I am worried about _________ because I see something that is not there.*

Today’s idea is useful for application to anything that seems to upset you, and can profitably be used throughout the day for that purpose. However, the three or four practice periods which are required should be preceded by a minute or so of mind searching, as before, and the application of the idea to each upsetting thought uncovered in the search.

Again, if you resist applying the idea to some upsetting thoughts more than to others, remind yourself of the two cautions stated in the previous lesson:

*There are no small upsets. They are all equally disturbing to my peace of mind.*

And:

*I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go. For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.*
