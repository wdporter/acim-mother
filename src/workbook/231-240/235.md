I need but look upon all things that seem to hurt me, and with perfect certainty assure myself, “God wills that I be saved from this,” and merely watch them disappear. I need but keep in mind my Mother’s Will for me is only happiness, to find that only happiness has come to me. And I need but remember that God’s Love surrounds Her Son and keeps his sinlessness forever perfect, to be sure that I am saved and safe forever in Her Arms. I am the Son She loves. And I am saved because God in Her mercy wills it so.

*Mother, Your Holiness is mine. Your Love created me, and made my sinlessness forever part of You. I have no guilt nor sin in me, for there is none in You.*
