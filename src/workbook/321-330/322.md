I sacrifice illusions; nothing more. And as illusions go I find the gifts illusions tried to hide, awaiting me in shining welcome, and in readiness to give God’s ancient messages to me. Her memory abides in every gift that I receive of Her. And every dream serves only to conceal the Self which is God’s only Son, the likeness of Herself, the Holy One Who still abides in Her forever, as He still abides in me.

<p class=italic>Mother, to You all sacrifice remains forever inconceivable. 
And so I cannot sacrifice except in dreams. 
As You created me, I can give up nothing You gave me. 
What You did not give has no reality. 
What loss can I anticipate except the loss of fear, and the return of love into my mind? <acim-org-link pagenumber={{pageNumber}} reference={{reference}}></acim-org-link></p>
