*Your Son is free, my Mother. Let me not imagine I have bound him with the laws I made to rule the body. He is not subject to any laws I made by which I try to make the body more secure. He is not changed by what is changeable. He is not slave to any laws of time. He is as You created him, because he knows no law except the law of love.*

Let us not worship idols, nor believe in any law idolatry would make to hide the freedom of the Son of God. He is not bound except by his beliefs. Yet what he is, is far beyond his faith in slavery or freedom. He is free because he is his Mother’s Son. And he cannot be bound unless God’s truth can lie, and God can will that She deceive Herself. <acim-org-link pagenumber={{pagenumber}} reference={{reference}}></acim-org-link>
