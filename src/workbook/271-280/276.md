What is the Word of God? “My Son is pure and holy as Myself.” And thus did God become the Mother of the Son She loves, for thus was he created. This the Word Her Son did not create with Her, because in this Her Son was born. Let us accept Her Motherhood, and all is given us. Deny we were created in Her Love and we deny our Self, to be unsure of Who we are, of Who our Mother is, and for what purpose we have come. And yet, we need but to acknowledge Her Who gave Her Word to us in our creation, to remember Her and so recall our Self.

Mother, Your Word is mine. And it is this that I would speak to all my companions, who are given me to cherish as my own, as I am loved and blessed and saved by You.
