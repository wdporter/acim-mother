A theoretical foundation such as the text is necessary as a background to make 
these exercises meaningful. Yet it is the exercises which will make the goal
possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose
of these exercises to train the mind to think along the lines which
the course sets forth.

The exercises are very simple. They do not require more than a few minutes, 
and it does not matter where or when you do them. They need no preparation. 
They are numbered, running from to 365. The training period is one year. Do
not undertake more than one exercise a day.

The purpose of these exercises is to train the mind to a different perception of
everything in the world. The workbook is divided into two sections,
the first dealing with the undoing of what you see now and the second
with the restoration of sight. It is recommended that each exercise
be repeated several times a day, preferably in a different place each
time and, if possible, in every situation in which you spend any long
period of time. The purpose is to train the mind to generalize the
lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is as
applicable to one situation as it is to another.

Unless specified to the contrary, the exercise should be practiced with the eyes 
open, since the aim is to learn how to see. The only rule that should be followed
throughout is to practice the exercises with great specificity. Each
one applies to every situation in which you find yourself and to
everything you see in it. Each day’s exercises are planned around
one central idea, the exercises themselves consisting of applying
that idea to as many specifics as possible. Be sure that you do not
decide that there are some things you see to which the idea for the
day is inapplicable. The aim of the exercises will always be to
increase the application of the idea to everything. This will not
require effort. Only be sure that you make no exceptions in applying
the idea.

Some of the ideas you will find hard to believe, and others will seem quite 
startling. It does not matter. You are merely asked to apply them to what you 
see. You are not asked to judge them, nor even to believe them. You are asked
only to use them. It is their use which will give them meaning to
you, and show you they are true. Remember only this — you need not
believe them, you need not accept them, and you need not welcome
them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter
nor decrease their efficacy. But allow yourself to make no exceptions
in applying the ideas the exercises contain. Whatever your reäctions
to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than this is
required.
