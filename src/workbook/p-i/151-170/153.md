You who feel threatened by
this changing world, its twists of fortune and its bitter jests, its
brief relationships and all the “gifts” it merely lends to
take away again, attend this lesson well. The world provides no safety. It
is rooted in attack and all its “gifts” of seeming safety
are illusory deceptions. It attacks and then attacks again. No peace
of mind is possible where danger threatens thus.

The world gives rise but to
defensiveness. For threat brings anger, anger makes attack seem
reasonable, honestly provoked, and righteous in the name of self
defense. Yet is defensiveness a double threat. For it attests to
weakness and sets up a system of defense that cannot work. Now are
the weak still further undermined, for there is treachery without and
still a greater treachery within. The mind is now confused and knows
not where to turn to find escape from its imaginings.

It is as if a circle held it fast, whereïn another circle bound it, and 
another in that one, until escape no longer can be hoped for nor obtained. 
Attack, defense; defense, attack, become the circles of the hours and the 
days that bind the mind in heavy bands of steel with iron overlaid, returning 
but to start again. There seems to be no break nor ending in the 
ever-tightening grip of imprisonment upon the mind. 

Defenses are the costliest
of all the prices which the ego would exact. In them lies madness in
a form so grim that hope of sanity seems but to be an idle dream,
beyond the possible. The sense of threat the world encourages is so
much deeper and so far beyond the frenzy and intensity of which you
can conceive that you have no idea of all the devastation it has
wrought. You are its slave. You know not what you do in fear of it.
You do not understand how much you have been made to sacrifice who
feel its iron grip upon your heart.

You do not realise what you
have done to sabotage the holy peace of God by your defensiveness.
For you behold the Child of God as but a victim to attack by fantasies,
by dreams, and by illusions they have made; yet helpless they are in their
presence, needful only of defense by still more fantasies and dreams
by which illusions of their safety comfort them.

Defenselessness is
strength. It testifies to recognition of the Christ in you. Perhaps
you will recall the course maintains that choice is always made
between His strength and your own weakness seen apart from Him.
Defenselessness can never be attacked because it recognises strength
so great attack is folly or a silly game a tired children might play 
when they become too sleepy to remember what they want.

Defensiveness is weakness.
It proclaims you have denied the Christ and come to fear His
Mother’s anger. What can save you now from your delusion of an
angry god whose fearful image you believe you see at work in all the
evils of the world? What but illusions could defend you now, when it
is but illusions which you fight?

We will not play such childish games today. For our true purpose is to save the world, and we would not exchange for foolishness the endless joy our function offers us. We would not let our happiness slip by because a senseless fragment of a dream happened to cross our minds, and we mistook the figures in it for the Child of God, its tiny instant for eternity.

We look past dreams today and recognise that we need no defense because we 
are created unassailable, without all thought or wish or dream in which attack 
has any meaning. Now we cannot fear, for we have left all fearful 
thoughts behind. And in defenselessness we stand secure, serenely 
certain of our safety now, sure of salvation; sure we will fulfil our 
chosen purpose as our ministry extends its holy blessing through the 
world.

Be still a moment, and in
silence think how holy is your purpose, how secure you rest,
untouchable within its light. God’s ministers have chosen that
the truth be with them. Who is holier than they? Who could be surer
that their happiness is fully guaranteed? And who could be more
mightily protected? What defense could possibly be needed now by
those who are among the chosen ones of God by Her election and their
own as well?

It is the function of
God’s ministers to help their companions choose as they have done.
God has elected all, but few have come to realise Her Will is but
their own. And while you fail to teach what you have learned,
salvation waits and darkness holds the world in grim imprisonment.
Nor will you learn that light has come to you, and your escape has
been accomplished. For you will not see the light until you offer it
to all your companions. As they take it from your hands, so will you
recognise it as your own.

Salvation can be thought
of as a game that happy children play. It was designed by One Who
loves Her children, and Who would replace their fearful toys with
joyous games which teach them that the game of fear is gone. Her game
instructs in happiness because there is no loser. Everyone who plays
must win, and in their winning is the gain to everyone ensured. The
game of fear is gladly laid aside when children come to see the
benefits salvation brings.

You who have played that
you are lost to hope, abandoned by your Mother, left alone in terror
in a fearful world made mad by sin and guilt, be happy now. That game
is over. Now a quiet time has come in which we put away the toys of
guilt and lock our quaint and childish thoughts of sin forever from
the pure and holy minds of Heaven’s children and the Child of God.
We pause but for a moment more to play our final happy game upon this
earth. And then we go to take our rightful place where truth abides
and games are meaningless.

So is the story ended. Let
this day bring the last chapter closer to the world that everyone may
learn the tales they read of terrifying destiny, defeat of all their
hopes, their pitiful defense against a vengeance they can not escape, are
but their own deluded fantasies. God’s ministers have come to waken
them from the dark dreams this story has evoked in their confused,
bewildered memory of this distorted tale. God’s Child can smile at
last on learning that it is not true.

Today we practice in a
form we will maintain for quite a while. We will begin each day by
giving our attention to the daily thought as long as possible. Five
minutes now becomes the least we give to preparation for a day in
which salvation is the only goal we have. Ten would be better; 15
better still. And as distraction ceases to arise to turn us from our
purpose, we will find that half an hour is too short a time to spend
with God. Nor will we willingly give less at night in gratitude and
joy.

Each hour adds to our
increasing peace, as we remember to be faithful to the Will we share
with God. At times, perhaps, a minute, even less, will be the most
that we can offer as the hour strikes. Sometimes we will forget. At
other times the business of the world will close on us, and we will
be unable to withdraw a little while and turn our thoughts to
God.

Yet when we can, we will
observe our trust as ministers of God in hourly remembrance of our
mission and Her Love. And we will quietly sit by and wait on Her and
listen to Her Voice and learn what She would have us do the hour that
is yet to come, while thanking Her for all the gifts She gave us in
the one gone by.

In time, with practice,
you will never cease to think of Her and hear Her loving Voice
guiding your footsteps into quiet ways where you will walk in true
defenselessness, for you will know that Heaven goes with you. Nor
would you keep your mind away from Her a moment, even though your
time is spent in offering salvation to the world. Think you She will
not make this possible for you who chose to carry out Her plan for
the salvation of the world and yours?

Today our theme is our
defenselessness. We clothe ourselves in it as we prepare to meet the
day. We rise up strong in Christ and let our weakness disappear as we
remember that His strength abides in us. We will remind ourselves
that He remains beside us through the day and never leaves our
weakness unsupported by His strength.

We call upon His strength each time we feel the threat of our defenses 
undermine our certainty of purpose. We will pause a moment as He tells us, “I 
am here”. Your practicing will now begin to take the earnestness of 
love to help you keep your mind from wandering from its intent.

Be not afraid nor timid.
There can be no doubt that you will reach your final goal. The
ministers of God can never fail because the love and strength and
peace that shine from them to all their companions come from Her. These
are Her gifts to you. Defenselessness is all you need to give Her in
return. You lay aside but what was never real to look on Christ and
see His sinlessness.
