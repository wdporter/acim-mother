What makes this world seem real except your own denial of the truth which lies beyond? What but your thoughts of misery and death obscure the perfect happiness and the Eternal Life your Mother wills for you? And what could hide what cannot be concealed except illusion? What could keep from you what you already have except your choice to see it not, denying it is
there?

The Thought of God created you. It left you not, nor have you ever been apart from It an instant. It belongs to you. By It you live. It is your Source of life, holding you one with It, and everything is one with you because It left you not. The Thought of God protects you, cares for you, makes soft your resting place and smooth your way, lighting your mind with happiness and love. Eternity and everlasting life shine in your mind because the Thought of God has left you not and still abides with you.

Who would deny their safety and their peace, their joy, their healing and their peace of mind, their quiet rest, their calm awakening if they but recognised where they abide? Would they not instantly prepare to go where they [peace/joy/healing/rest/calm] are found, abandoning all else as worthless in comparison with them?  And having found them, would they [the recognisers] not make sure they stay with them [peace/joy/healing/rest/calm] and they [the recognisers] remain with them [peace/joy/healing/rest/calm]?

Deny not Heaven. It is yours today but for the asking. Nor need you perceive how great the gift, how changed your mind will be before it comes to you. Ask to receive, and it is given you. Conviction lies within it. Until you welcome it as yours, uncertainty remains. Yet God is fair. Sureness is not required to receive what only your acceptance can bestow.

Ask with desire. You need not be sure that you request the only thing you want. But when you have received, you will be sure you have the treasure you have always sought. What would you then exchange it for? What would induce you now to let it fade away from your ecstatic vision? For this sight proves that you have exchanged your blindness for the seeing eyes of Christ; your mind has come to lay aside denial and accept the Thought of God as its inheritance.

Now is all doubting past, the journey’s end made certain, and salvation given you. Now is Christ’s power in your mind to heal as you were healed. For now you are among the saviours of the world. Your destiny lies there and nowhere else. Would God consent to let Her Child remain forever starved by their denial of the nourishment they need to live? Abundance dwells in them, and deprivation cannot cut them off from God’s sustaining Love and from their home.

Practice today in hope. For hope indeed is justified. Your doubts are meaningless, for God is certain. And the Thought of Her is never absent. Sureness must abide within you who are host to Her. This course removes all doubts which you have interposed between Her and your certainty of Her. We count on God and not upon ourselves to give us certainty. And in Her Name we practice as Her Word directs we do. Her sureness lies beyond our every doubt. Her Love remains beyond our every fear. The Thought of Her is still beyond all dreams and in our minds according to Her Will.
