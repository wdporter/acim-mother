What time but now can truth be recognised? The present is the only time there 
is. And so today, this instant, now, we come to look upon what is forever 
there — not in our sight, but in the eyes of Christ. He looks past time and 
sees eternity as represented there. He hears the sounds the senseless busy 
world engenders, yet He hears them faintly, for beyond them all He hears the 
song of Heaven and the Voice of God more clear, more meaningful, more near. 

The world fades easily away before His sight. Its sounds grow dim. A melody 
from far beyond the world increasingly is more and more distinct — an ancient 
call to which He gives an ancient answer. You will recognise them both. For 
they are but your answer to your Mother’s call to you. Christ answers for 
you, echoing your Self, using your voice to give His glad consent, accepting 
your deliverance for you.

How holy is your practicing today, as Christ gives you His sight and hears for 
you and answers in your name the call He hears. How quiet is the time you give 
to spend with Him beyond the world. How easily are all your seeming sins 
forgot and all your sorrows unremembered. On this day is grief laid by, for 
sights and sounds which come from nearer than the world are made clear to you 
who will today accept the gifts He gives.

There is a silence into which the world can not intrude. There is an ancient 
peace you carry in your heart and have not lost. There is a sense of holiness 
in you the thought of sin has never touched. All this today you will remember. Faithfulness in practicing today will bring rewards so great and so completely different from all things you sought before that you will know that here your 
treasure is and here your rest.

This is the day when vain imaginings part like a curtain to reveal what lies 
beyond them. Now is what is really there made visible, while all the shadows 
which appeared to hide it sink to obscurity. Now is the balance righted and 
the scales of judgement left to Him Who judges true. And in His judgement will 
a world unfold in perfect innocence before your eyes. Now will you see it with 
the eyes of Christ. Now is its transformation clear to you.

Friends, this day is sacred to the world. Your vision, given you from far 
beyond all things within the world, looks back on them in a new light. And 
what you see becomes the healing and salvation of the world. The valuable and 
valueless are both perceived and recognised for what they are. And what is 
worthy of your love receives your love, while nothing to be feared remains.

We will not judge today. We will receive but what is given us from judgement 
made beyond the world. Our practicing today becomes our gift of thankfulness 
for our release from blindness and from misery. All that we see will but 
increase our joy because its holiness reflects our own. We stand forgiven in 
the sight of Christ, with all the world forgiven in our own.

We bless the world as we behold it in the light in which our Saviour looks on 
us and offer it the freedom given us through His forgiving vision, now our 
own. Open the curtain in your practicing by merely letting go all things you 
think you want. Your trifling treasures put away and leave a clean and open 
space within your mind where Christ can come and offer you the treasure of 
salvation. He has need of your most holy mind to save the world.

Is not this purpose worthy to be yours? Is not Christ’s vision worthy to be 
sought above the world’s unsatisfying goals? Let not today slip by without the 
gifts it holds for you receiving your consent and your acceptance. We can 
change the world if you acknowledge them. You may not see the value your 
acceptance gives the world. But this you surely want — you can exchange all 
suffering for joy this very day. Practice in earnest, and the gift is yours. 
Would God deceive you? Can Her promise fail? Can you withhold so little when 
Her Hand holds out complete salvation to Her Child?
