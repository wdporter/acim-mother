Today’s idea accurately describes the way anyone who holds attack thoughts in 
their mind must see the world. Having projected their anger onto the world, 
they see vengeance about to strike at them. Their own attack is thus perceived 
as self-defence. This becomes an increasingly vicious circle until they are 
willing to change how they see. Otherwise, thoughts of attack and 
counter-attack will preöccupy them and people their entire world. What peace 
of mind is possible to them then?

It is from this savage fantasy that you want to escape. Is it not joyous news 
to hear that it is not real? Is it not a happy discovery to find that you can 
escape? You made what you would destroy — everything that you hate and would 
attack and kill. All that you fear does not exist.

Look at the world about you at least five times today, for at least a minute 
each time. As your eyes move slowly from one object to another, from one body 
to another, say to yourself:

*I see only the perishable. \
I see nothing that will last. \
What I see is not real. \
What I see is a form of vengeance.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

At the end of each practice period, ask yourself:

*Is this the world I really want to see?* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

The answer is surely obvious.
