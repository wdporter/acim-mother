The exercises with this idea are very similar to the preceding ones. Again, it is 
necessary to name both the form of upset (anger, fear, worry, depression, and 
so on) and the perceived source very specifically for any application 
of the idea. For example: 

*I am angry at ___ because I see something that is not there.\
I am worried about ___ because I see something that is not there.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

Today’s idea is useful for application to anything that seems to upset you and 
can profitably be used throughout the day for that purpose. However, the 
three or four practice periods which are required should be preceded 
by a minute or so of mind searching, as before, and the application 
of the idea to each upsetting thought uncovered in the search. 

Again, if you resist applying the idea to some upsetting thoughts more than to 
others, remind yourself of the two cautions stated in the previous lesson:

*There are no small upsets. They are all equally disturbing to my peace of mind.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

And:

*I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go. For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}
