Apply this idea in the same way as the previous ones, without making 
distinctions of any kind. Whatever you see becomes a proper subject for 
applying the idea. Be sure that you do not question the suitability of anything 
for the application of the idea. These are not exercises in judgement.
Anything is suitable if you see it. Some of the things you see may
have emotionally-charged meaning for you. Try to lay such feelings
aside, and merely use these things exactly as you would anything
else.

The point of the exercises is to help you clear your mind of all past associations, 
to see things exactly as they appear to you now, and to realize how little 
you really understand about them. It is therefore essential that you 
keep a perfectly open mind, unhampered by judgement, in selecting the 
things to which the idea for the day is to be applied. For this 
purpose one thing is like another — equally suitable and therefore 
equally useful.
