This idea obviously follows from the two preceding ones. But while you may be 
able to accept it intellectually, it is unlikely that it will mean anything to you as 
yet. However, understanding is not necessary at this point. In fact, 
the recognition that you do not understand is a prerequisite for 
undoing your false ideas. These exercises are concerned with 
practice, not with understanding. You do not need to practice what 
you really understand. It would indeed be circular to aim at 
understanding and assume that you have it already. 

It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what seems to be pictured 
before it is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing and may meet with 
active resistance in any number of forms. Yet that does not preclude 
applying it. No more than that is required for these or any other 
exercises. Each little step will clear a little of the darkness away, 
and understanding will finally come to lighten every corner of the 
mind which has been cleared of the debris that darkens it.

These exercises, for which three or four practice periods are sufficient, involve looking about you and applying the idea for the day to whatever you see, 
remembering the need for its indiscriminate application and the 
essential rule of excluding nothing. For example: 

*I do not see this typewriter as it is now.\
I do not see this key as it is now.\
I do not see this telephone as it is now.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

Begin with things that are nearest you, and then extend the range:

*I do not see that coat rack as it is now.\
I do not see that face as it is now.\
I do not see that door as it is now.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

It is emphasised again that while complete inclusion should not be attempted, 
specific exclusion must be avoided. Be sure you are honest in making this 
distinction. You may be tempted to obscure it.
