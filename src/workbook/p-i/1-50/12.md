The importance of this idea lies in the fact that it contains a correction for a 
major perceptual distortion. You think that what upsets you is a frightening 
world, or a sad world, or a violent world, or an insane world. All these 
attributes are given it by you. The world is meaningless in itself.

These exercises are done with eyes open. Look around you, this time quite 
slowly. Try to pace yourself so that the slow shifting of your glance from one 
thing to another involves a fairly constant time interval. Do not allow the 
time of the shift to become markedly longer or shorter, but try, 
instead, to keep a measured, even tempo throughout. What you see does 
not matter. You teach yourself this as you give whatever your glance 
rests on equal attention and equal time. This is a beginning step in 
learning to give them all equal value. 

As you look about you, say to yourself: 

*I think I see a fearful world, a dangerous world, a hostile world, a sad world, a wicked world, a crazy world;* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

and so on, using whatever descriptive terms happen to occur to you. If terms 
which seem positive rather than negative occur to you, include them. For 
example, you might think of a “good world”, or a “satisfying world”. If such 
terms occur to you, use them along with the rest. You may not yet understand 
why these “nice” adjectives belong in these exercises, but remember 
that a “good world” implies a “bad” one, and a “satisfying world” implies an 
“unsatisfying” one. All terms which cross your mind are suitable subjects for 
today’s exercises. Their seeming quality does not matter.

Be sure that you do not alter the time intervals between applying today’s idea 
to what you think is pleasant and what you think is unpleasant. For the 
purposes of these exercises, there is no difference between them. At 
the end of the practice period, add:

*But I am upset because I see a meaningless world.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

What is meaningless is neither good nor bad. Why, then, should a meaningless 
world upset you? If you could accept the world as meaningless and let the truth 
be written upon it for you, it would make you indescribably happy. 
But because it is meaningless, you are impelled to write upon it what 
you would have it be. It is this you see in it. It is this that is 
meaningless in truth. Beneath your words is written the Word of God. 
The truth upsets you now, but when your words have been erased, you 
will see His. That is the ultimate purpose of these exercises.

Three or four times are enough for practicing the idea for today. Nor should the 
practice periods exceed a minute. You may find even this too long. Terminate 
the exercises whenever you experience a sense of strain.
