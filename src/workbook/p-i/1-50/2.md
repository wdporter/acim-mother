The exercises with this idea are the same as those for the first one. Begin with 
the things that are near you, and apply the idea to whatever your glance rests 
on. Then increase the range outward. Turn your head so that you include 
whatever is to either side. If possible, turn around and apply the idea to what 
was behind you. Remain as indiscriminate as possible in selecting subjects for its 
application, do not concentrate on anything in particular, and do not attempt to 
include everything in an area or you will introduce strain. Merely glance 
easily and fairly quickly around you, trying to avoid selection by 
size, brightness, color, material or relative importance to you.

Take the subjects simply as you see them. Try to apply the exercise with equal 
ease to a body or a button, a fly or a floor, an arm or an apple. The sole criterion 
for applying the idea to anything is merely that your eyes have 
lighted on it. Make no attempt to include anything particular, but be 
sure that nothing is specifically excluded.
