Now look slowly around you,
and practice applying this idea very specifically to whatever you
see:

*This table does not mean anything.\
This chair does not mean anything.\
This hand does not mean anything.\
This foot does not mean anything.\
This pen does not mean anything.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

Then look farther away from
your immediate area, and apply the idea to a wider range:

*That door does not mean anything.\
That body does not mean anything.\
That lamp does not mean anything.\
That sign does not mean anything.\
That shadow does not mean anything.* {.ml-8 .mr-8}

Notice that these statements are not arranged in any order, and make no 
allowance for differences in the kinds of things to which they are applied. That is
the purpose of the exercise. The statement is merely applied to
anything you see. As you practice applying the idea for the day, use
it totally indiscriminately. Do not attempt to apply it to everything
you see, for these exercises should not become ritualistic. Only be
sure that nothing you see is specifically excluded. One thing is like
another as far as the application of the idea is concerned.
