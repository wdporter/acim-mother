The idea for today is another step in learning that the thoughts which give rise 
to what you see are never neutral or unimportant. It also emphasises the idea 
that minds are joined, which will be given increasing stress later.

Today’s idea does not refer to what you see as much as to how you see it. 
Therefore, the exercises for today will emphasise this aspect of your perception. 
The three or four practice periods which are recommended should be done as 
follows:

Selecting subjects for the application of the idea randomly, look at each one 
long enough to say:

*I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see ___.* {.ml-12 .mr-12}

Conclude the practice period by repeating the more general statement:

*I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my seeing.* {.ml-12 .mr-12}

A minute or so or even less will be sufficient.
