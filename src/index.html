<h3>Text</h3>
<p>This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time …<!-- you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time. The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love’s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite. --><a href="text">read more</a></p> 

<h3>Workbook for Students</h3>
<p>A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful. Yet it is doing …<!-- the exercises that will make the goal of the course possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth. --><a href="workbook">read more</a></p> 

<h3>Manual for Teachers</h3>
<p>The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. The reversal is …<!-- characteristic. It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teachers giving something to the learner rather than to themselves. Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity, in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of one’s time. The course, on the other hand, emphasizes that to teach <em>is</em> to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same. It also emphasizes that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day, and continues into sleeping thoughts as well. --><a href="manual">read more</a></p>

<h3>Clarification of Terms</h3>
<p>This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with…<!--  Atonement, or the correction of perception. The means of the Atonement is forgiveness. The structure of “individual consciousness” is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the “original error” or the “original sin.” To study the error itself does not lead to correction, if you are indeed to succeed in overlooking the error. And it is just this process of overlooking at which the course aims.--> <a href="clarification">read more</a></p>

<h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
<p>Psychotherapy is the only form of therapy there is.  Since only the mind can be sick, …<!--only the mind can be healed. Only the mind is in need of healing. This does not appear to be the case, for the manifestations of this world seem real indeed. Psychotherapy is necessary so that individuals can begin to question their reality. Sometimes they are able to start to open their mind without formal help, but even then it is always some change in their perception of interpersonal relationships that enables them to do so. Sometimes they need a more structured, extended relationship with an “official” therapist. Either way, the task is the same; patients must be helped to change their mind about the “reality” of illusions. --><a href="psychotherapy/">read more</a></p>

<h3>Song of Prayer</h3>
<p>Prayer is the greatest gift with which God blessed Her Son at his creation. It was then what it …<!--is to become; the single voice Creator and creation share; the song the Son sings to the Mother, Who returns the thanks it offers Her unto the Son. Endless the harmony, and endless, too, the joyous concord of the Love They give forever to Each Other. And in this, creation is extended. God gives thanks to Her extension in Her Son. Her Son gives thanks for his creation, in the song of his creating in his Mother’s Name. The Love They share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time is done. For such it was before time seemed to be.--> <a href="song">read more</a></p>
