Who, then, is the therapist, and who is the patient? In the end, everyone is both. They who need healing must heal. “Physician, heal yourself”. Who else is there to heal? And who else is in need of healing? Each patient who comes to a therapist offers them [therapist] a chance to heal themself. They [the patient] are therefore their [the therapist’s] therapist. And every therapist must learn to heal from each patient who comes to them [the therapist]. They [the therapist] thus become their [the patient’s] patient. God does not know of separation. What She knows is only that She has one Child. Her knowledge is reflected in the ideal patient–therapist relationship. God comes to them who call, and in Her they recognise Themself.

Think carefully, teacher and therapist, for whom you pray, and who is in need of healing. For therapy is prayer, and healing is its aim and its result. What is prayer except the joining of minds in a relationship which Christ can enter? This is His home, into which psychotherapy invites Him. What is symptom cure, when another is always there to choose? But once Christ enters in, what choice is there except to have Him stay? There is no need for more than this, for it is everything. Healing is here, and happiness and peace. These are the ʺsymptomsʺ of the ideal patient–therapist relationship, replacing those with which the patient came to ask for help.

The process that takes place in this relationship is actually one in which therapists in their heart tell the patient that all their [the patient’s] sins have been forgiven them, along with their [the therapist’s] own. What could be the difference between healing and forgiveness? Only Christ forgives, knowing His sinlessness. His vision heals perception and sickness disappears. Nor will it return again, once its cause has been removed. This, however, needs the help of a very advanced therapist, capable of joining with the patient in a holy relationship in which all sense of separation finally is overcome.

For this, one thing and one thing only is required: Therapists in no way confuses themselves with God. All ʺunhealed healersʺ make this fundamental confusion in one form or another, because they must regard themselves as self‐created rather than God‐created. This confusion is rarely if ever in awareness, or the unhealed healer would instantly become Teachers of God, devoting their life to the function of true healing. Before they reached this point, they thought they were in charge of the therapeutic process and were therefore responsible for its outcome. Their patientʹs failures thus became their own mistakes, and guilt became the cover, dark and strong, for what should be the Holiness of Christ. Guilt is inevitable in those who use their judgement in making their decisions. Guilt is impossible in those through whom the Holy Spirit speaks.

The passing of guilt is the true aim of therapy and the obvious aim of forgiveness. In this their oneness can be clearly seen. Yet who could experience the end of guilt who feels responsible for their companion in the role of guide for them? Such a function presupposes a knowledge that no one here can have; a certainty of past, present and future, and of all the effects that may occur in them. Only from this omniscient point of view would such a role be possible. Yet no perception is omniscient, nor is the tiny self of one alone against the universe able to assume they have such wisdom except in madness. That many therapists are mad is obvious. No unhealed healer can be wholly sane.

Yet it is as insane not to accept a function God has given you as to invent one She has not. The advanced therapist in no way can ever doubt the power that is in them. Nor do they doubt its Source. They understand all power in earth and Heaven belongs to them because of who they are. And they are this because of their Creator, Whose Love is in them and Who cannot fail. Think what this means; they have the gifts of God Herself to give away. Their patients are Godʹs saints, who call upon their [therapist’s] sanctity to make it theirs [patient’s]. And as they [therapist] gives it to them [patient], they [therapist] behold Christʹs shining face as it looks back at them.

The insane, thinking they are God, are not afraid to offer weakness to the Child of God. But what they [the insane] see in them [Child of God] because of this they [the insane] fear indeed. Unhealed healers cannot but be fearful of their patients, and suspect them [patient] of the treachery they [unhealed healer] sees in them [patient]. They [unhealed healer] try to heal, and thus at times they may. But they will not succeed except to some extent and for a little while. They does not see the Christ in they who call. What answer can they [unhealed healer] give to one who seems to be a stranger; alien to the truth and poor in wisdom, without the god who must be given them [stranger/alien/poor]? Behold your God in him, for what you see will be your Answer.

Think what the joining of two companions really means. And then forget the world and all its little triumphs and its dreams of death. The same are one, and nothing now can be remembered of the world of guilt. The room becomes a temple, and the street a stream of stardust brushing lightly past all sickly dreams. Healing is done, for what is perfect needs no healing, and what remains to be forgiven where there is no sin?

Be thankful, therapist, that you can see such things as this, if you but understand your proper role. But if you fail in that, you have denied that God created you, and so you will not know you are Her Child. Who is your companion now? What saint can come to take you home with them? You lost the way. And can you now expect to see in them an answer that you have refused to give? Heal and be healed. There is no other choice of pathways that can ever lead to peace. Oh let your patient in, for they have come to you from God. Is not their holiness enough to wake your memory of Her?
