Yet the ideal outcome is rarely achieved. But psychotherapy
begins with the realization that healing is of the mind, and in
psychotherapy those have come together who believe this. It may
be they will not get much further, for no‐one learns beyond their own
readiness. Yet levels of readiness change, and when therapist or
patient has reached the next one, there will be a relationship held
out to them that meets the changing need. Perhaps they will come
together again and advance in the same relationship, making it
holier. Or perhaps each of them will enter into another
commitment. Be assured of this; each will progress. Retrogression
is temporary. The overall direction is one of progress toward the
truth.

Psychotherapy itself cannot be creative. This is one of the
errors which the ego fosters; that it is capable of true change, and
therefore of true creativity. When we speak of ʺthe saving illusionʺ
or ʺthe final dream,ʺ this is not what we mean, but here is the egoʹs
last defense. ʺResistanceʺ is its way of looking at things; its
interpretation of “progress” and “growth.” These interpretations
will be wrong of necessity, because they are delusional. The
“changes” the ego seeks to make are not really changes. They are
but deeper shadows, or perhaps different cloud patterns. Yet what
is made of nothingness cannot be called new or different. Illusions
are illusions; truth is truth.

Resistance as defined here can be characteristic of a
therapist as well as of a patient. Either way, it sets a limit on
psychotherapy because it restricts its aims. Nor can the Holy Spirit
fight against the intrusions of the ego on the therapeutic process.
But He will wait, and His patience is infinite. His goal is wholly
undivided always. Whatever resolutions patient and therapist reach
in connection with their own divergent goals, they cannot become
completely reconciled as one until they join with His. Only then is
all conflict over, for only then can there be certainty.

Ideally, psychotherapy is a series of holy encounters in which
companions meet to bless each other and to receive the peace of God.
And this will one day come to pass for every ʺpatientʺ on the face of
this earth, for who except a patient could possibly have come here?
Therapists are only a somewhat more specialized Teacher of God.
They learns through teaching, and the more advanced they are the more
they teach and the more they learns. But whatever stage they are in, there
are patients who need them just that way. They [patients] cannot take more
than they [therapists] can give for now. Yet they both will find sanity at last.
