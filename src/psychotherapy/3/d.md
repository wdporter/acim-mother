Psychotherapists are a leaders in the sense that they walk
slightly ahead of the patient, and help them to avoid a few of the
pitfalls along the road by seeing them first. Ideally, they are also followers, for One should walk ahead of them to give them light to see.
Without this One, both will merely stumble blindly on to nowhere.
It is, however, impossible that this One be wholly absent if the goal
is healing. They [this One] may, however, not be recognized. And so the little
light that can be then accepted is all there is to light the way to truth.

Healing is limited by the limitations of the psychotherapist,
as it is limited by those of the patient. The aim of the process,
therefore, is to transcend these limits. Neither can do this alone, but
when they join, the potentiality for transcending all limitations has
been given them. Now the extent of their success depends on how
much of this potentiality they are willing to use. The willingness
may come from either one at the beginning, and as the other shares
it, it will grow. Progress becomes a matter of decision; it can reach
almost to Heaven or go no further than a step or two from hell.

It is quite possible for psychotherapy to seem to fail. It is
even possible for the result to look like retrogression. But in the end
there must be some success. One asks for help; another hears and
tries to answer in the form of help. This is the formula for salvation,
and must heal. Divided goals alone can interfere with perfect
healing. One wholly egoless therapist could heal the world without
a word, merely by being there. No‐one need see them or talk to them
or even know of their existence. Their simple Presence is enough to
heal.

The ideal therapist is one with Christ. But healing is a
process, not a fact. The therapist cannot progress without the
patient, and patients cannot be ready to receive the Christ or they
could not be sick. In a sense, the egoless psychotherapist is an
abstraction that stands at the end of the process of healing, too
advanced to believe in sickness and too near to God to keep their feet
on earth. Now they can help through those in need of help, for thus
they carry out the plan established for salvation. The
psychotherapist becomes their [the egoless therapist’s] patient, working through other
patients to express their [the egoless therapist’s] thoughts as they receive them from the Mind
of Christ.
