 <h2>T-20.I The Vision of Holiness</h2>
<p>This is Palm Sunday, the celebration of victory and the acceptance of the
truth. Let us not spend this holy week brooding on the crucifixion of God’s
Son, but happily in the celebration of his release. For Easter is the sign of
peace, not pain. A slain Christ has no meaning. But a risen Christ becomes the
symbol of the Son of God’s forgiveness on himself; the sign he looks upon
himself as healed and whole.</p>

<p>This week begins with palms and ends with lilies, the white and holy sign the
Son of God is innocent. Let no dark sign of crucifixion intervene between the
journey and its purpose; between the acceptance of the truth and its
expression. This week we celebrate life, not death. And we honour the perfect
purity of the Son of God, and not his sins. Offer your companion the gift of
lilies, not the crown of thorns; the gift of love and not the “gift” of fear.
You stand beside your companion, thorns in one hand and lilies in the other,
uncertain which to give. Join now with me and throw away the thorns, offering
the lilies to replace them. This Easter I would have the gift of your
forgiveness offered by you to me, and returned by me to you. We cannot be
united in crucifixion and in death. Nor can the resurrection be complete until
your forgiveness rests on Christ, along with mine.</p>
<p>A week is short, and yet this holy week is the symbol of the whole journey the
Son of God has undertaken. He started with the sign of victory, the promise of
the resurrection, already given him. Let him not wander into the temptation of
crucifixion, and delay him there. Help him to go in peace beyond it, with the
light of his own innocence lighting his way to his redemption and release.
Hold him not back with thorns and nails when his redemption is so near. But
let the whiteness of your shining gift of lilies speed him on his way to
resurrection.</p>
<p>Easter is not the celebration of the <em>cost</em> of sin, but of its <em>end.</em> If you
see glimpses of the face of Christ behind the veil, looking between the
snow-white petals of the lilies you have received and given as your gift, you
will behold your companions’ face and recognise it. I was a stranger and you
took me in, not knowing who I was. Yet for your gift of lilies you will know.
In your forgiveness of these strangers, aliens to you and yet your ancient
Friends, lies their release and your redemption with them. The time of Easter
is a time of joy, and not of mourning. Look on your risen Friends, and
celebrate their holiness along with me. For Easter is the time of your
salvation, along with mine. <a href="https://acim.org/acim/en/s/242?wid=toc#1" class=whitespace-nowrap title="view on acim.org">T-20.I</a></p>
